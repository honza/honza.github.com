<p>Bibles are notorious for being cluttered with all kinds of content besides the
actual Word of God.  Here is a list of common&nbsp;things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Chapter&nbsp;numbers</li>
<li>Verse&nbsp;numbers</li>
<li>Chapter&nbsp;headings</li>
<li>Translation&nbsp;footnotes</li>
<li>Cross-references (in the text, and in the center&nbsp;column)</li>
<li>Chain&nbsp;references</li>
<li>Pilcrows</li>
</ul>
<p>The traditional setting also includes things&nbsp;like:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Double&nbsp;column</li>
<li>Verse-by-verse setting (where each verse starts on a new&nbsp;line)</li>
<li>Words in&nbsp;italics</li>
<li>Pronunciation&nbsp;marks</li>
</ul>
<p>While these tools might be helpful for study, they certain don&#8217;t help with
fluency in reading.  They get in the way of your flow.  As a result, you might
become tired more&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>Instead, if bibles are to be read for extended periods of time, we should design
them in such a way to support that goal.  This usually&nbsp;means:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Single&nbsp;column</li>
<li>Larger&nbsp;font</li>
<li>No&nbsp;references</li>
<li>Paragraph&nbsp;format</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what the vast majority of novels produced today looks like.  Novels are
works of fiction meant for enjoyment.  You should be able to read them
comfortably and&nbsp;easily.</p>
<p>Why shouldn&#8217;t we be free to read our bibles this&nbsp;way?</p>
<p>Above, you see the first few sentences of the first chapter of Jane Austen&#8217;s
<em>Pride and Prejudice</em>.  I broke it up into verses, started each verse on a new
line, added some references and footnotes, and pilcrows.  You will also notice
the center column for references.  The proportions of the page have been
inspired by <span class="caps">R.L.</span> Allan&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC0VIrRCpPA">Longprimer 62</a>.</p>
<p>There is a <a class="reference external" href="/img/austen.pdf"><span class="caps">PDF</span></a> of the whole page for&nbsp;download.</p>
