<p>Bibles are notorious for being cluttered with all kinds of content besides the
actual Word of God.  Here is a list of common things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chapter numbers</li>
<li>Verse numbers</li>
<li>Chapter headings</li>
<li>Translation footnotes</li>
<li>Cross-references (in the text, and in the center column)</li>
<li>Chain references</li>
<li>Pilcrows</li>
</ul>

<p>The traditional setting also includes things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Double column</li>
<li>Verse-by-verse setting (where each verse starts on a new line)</li>
<li>Words in italics</li>
<li>Pronunciation marks</li>
</ul>

<p>While these tools might be helpful for study, they certain don&rsquo;t help with
fluency in reading.  They get in the way of your flow.  As a result, you might
become tired more quickly.</p>

<p>Instead, if bibles are to be read for extended periods of time, we should design
them in such a way to support that goal.  This usually means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Single column</li>
<li>Larger font</li>
<li>No references</li>
<li>Paragraph format</li>
</ul>

<p>This is what the vast majority of novels produced today looks like.  Novels are
works of fiction meant for enjoyment.  You should be able to read them
comfortably and easily.</p>

<p>Why shouldn&rsquo;t we be free to read our bibles this way?</p>

<p>Above, you see the first few sentences of the first chapter of Jane Austen&rsquo;s
<em>Pride and Prejudice</em>.  I broke it up into verses, started each verse on a new
line, added some references and footnotes, and pilcrows.  You will also notice
the center column for references.  The proportions of the page have been
inspired by R.L. Allan&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC0VIrRCpPA">Longprimer 62</a>.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="/img/austen.pdf">PDF</a> of the whole page for download.</p>
