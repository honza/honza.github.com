            <content type="html">
              Is prayer a vibration? Recently, I came across an item someone in my Facebook timeline shared. The author was thinking about what prayer is. Here is what it said: Do you pray? I love this interpretation of a Prayer. What is a prayer? Prayer doesn’t only happen when we kneel or put our hands together and focus and expect things from God. Thinking positive and wishing good for others is a prayer. When you hug a friend. That’s a prayer. When you cook something to nourish family and friends. That’s a prayer. When we send off our near and dear ones say, “Drive safely” or “Be safe”. That’s a prayer. When you are helping someone in need by giving your time and energy. You are praying. Prayer is a vibration. A feeling. A thought. Prayer is the voice of love, friendship, genuine relationships. Prayer is an expression of your silent being. Keep praying always… The interesting part is that this person is a professed Christian. How can someone who regularly attends a church service where the Word of God is preached arrive at a definition like this one? The modern evangelical church has lost its rigor in teaching pure doctrine to its members. There is often very little structure and precision. I’d suggest that we have failed our people if we neglect to explain such basic concepts as prayer. However, since the Reformation, there has been a strong tradition of teaching doctrine in the form of catechism: prepared questions and answers that the students were expected to memorize. From a young age, children were taught how to articulate the core tenets of their faith. The catechism explains doctrines of Scripture, sin, justification, sanctification, repentance; it covers the ten commandments, and the Lord’s prayer. This practice is unfortunately foreign to the modern evangelical church. Why am I bring all this up? Here is Question 98 of the Westminster Shorter Catechism, it asks “What is prayer?”. Here is the answer succinct answer which wonderfully summarizes what prayer is according to the Scriptures: Prayer is an offering up of our desires unto God, for things agreeable to his will, in the name of Christ, with confession of our sins, and thankful acknowledgment of his mercies. If you have memorized a catechism, you will have a framework in your mind by which you can assess new ideas coming at your from social media. It can serve as a useful sieve for quickly determining what is pure doctrine, and what is of the world. And lastly, here is an example of how to catechize your children on the Lord’s day.

            <content type="html">
              Red-letter theology Several weeks ago, I had a few friends over to our house to watch Les Lanphere’s excellent Calvinist documentary. I assumed this would be their first exposure to Reformed theology, so I expected some lively discussion. About half way through the movie, we had to pause to answer a simple clarification question. Once that was done, one of the guys volunteered an interesting observation. He said: “I hope they show some quotes from Jesus, too. So far it’s just been Paul in Romans and Ephesians. I wonder what Jesus has to say about that.” This little comment has been on my mind ever since. The traditional typography of Bibles on the North American usually includes words of Christ in red. Having grown up in Europe, I didn’t encounter this until I came to Canada about ten years ago. The motivation behind this typographic design is to give reverence to the words of Christ because when he speaks, God himself speaks. Unfortunately, what this leads to is that people treat other parts of the Bible as less important. If it’s not red, it’s as if you don’t really have to believe it. This is a really bad way of reading the Bible and doing theology in general. A small typographic detail can make a huge difference in how we think about what we’re reading. It might be helpful for us to stop and think about the features of our Bibles to see how all the references, footnotes, verse numbers, section headings, verse-by-verse layouts affect our reading and understanding of the text of Scripture.

            <content type="html">
              Comparing editions of the Institutes The way I see it, you have three options when selection an edition of John Calvin’s Institutes of the Christian Religion. The final edition of 1559 translated by Henry Beveridge, published in 1867. The final edition of 1559 translated by Ford Lewis Battles, published in 1960. The French edition of 1541 translated by Robert White, published in 2014. Beveridge With Beveridge, you get the full text of the Institutes. The language is somewhat archaic and a bit convoluted sometimes. It’s a lot easier to read than the Puritans. This translation is in the public domain, so you can read it for free online, and printed editions are relatively cheap. Book 1, Chapter 1, Section 2 On the other hand, it is evident that man never attains to a true self-knowledge until he have previously contemplated the face of God, and come down after such contemplation to look into himself. For (such is our innate pride) we always seem to ourselves just, and upright, and wise, and holy, until we are convinced, by clear evidence, of our injustice, vileness, folly, and impurity. Convinced, however, we are not, if we look to ourselves only, and not to the Lord also—he being the only standard by the application of which this conviction can be produced. For, since we are all naturally prone to hypocrisy, any empty semblance of righteousness is quite enough to satisfy us instead of righteousness itself. And since nothing appears within us or around us that is not tainted with very great impurity, so long as we keep our mind within the confines of human pollution, anything which is in some small degree less defiled delights us as if it were most pure: just as an eye, to which nothing but black had been previously presented, deems an object of a whitish, or even of a brownish hue, to be perfectly white. No, the bodily sense may furnish a still stronger illustration of the extent to which we are deluded in estimating the powers of the mind. If, at mid-day, we either look down to the ground, or on the surrounding objects which lie open to our view, we think ourselves endued with a very strong and piercing eyesight; but when we look up to the sun, and gaze at it unveiled, the sight which did excellently well for the earth is instantly so dazzled and confounded by the refulgence, as to oblige us to confess that our acuteness in discerning terrestrial objects is mere dimness when applied to the sun. Thus, too, it happens in estimating our spiritual qualities. So long as we do not look beyond the earth, we are quite pleased with our own righteousness, wisdom, and virtue; we address ourselves in the most flattering terms, and seem only less than demigods. Battles With Battles, you get the full text in its final form. This is the academic reference edition. If you are going to write a paper or a book, and you want to quote Calvin, use this. The language is much more modern than Beveridge but still a bit technical at times. The biggest downside of this edition is that it comes in two volumes and it’s very expensive. Book 1, Chapter 1, Section 2 Again, it is certain that man never achieves a clear knowledge of himself unless he has first looked upon God’s face, and then descends from contemplating him to scrutinize himself. For we always seem to ourselves righteous and upright and wise and holy—this pride is innate in all of us—unless by clear proofs we stand convinced of our own unrighteousness, foulness, folly, and impurity. Moreover, we are not thus convinced if we look merely to ourselves and not also to the Lord, who is the sole standard by which this judgment must be measured. For, because all of us are inclined by nature to hypocrisy, a kind of empty image of righteousness in place of righteousness itself abundantly satisfies us. And because nothing appears within or around us that has not been contaminated by great immorality, what is a little less vile pleases us as a thing most pure—so long as we confine our minds within the limits of human corruption. Just so, an eye to which nothing is shown but black objects judges something dirty white or even rather darkly mottle to be whiteness itself. Indeed, we can discern still more clearly from the bodily senses how much we are deluded in estimating the powers of the soul. For if in broad daylight we either look down upon the ground or survey whatever meets our view round about, we seem to ourselves endowed with the strongest and keenest sight; yet when we look up to the sun and gaze straight at it, that power of sight which was particularly strong on earth is at once blunted and confused by a great brilliance, and thus we are compelled to admin that our keenness in looking upon things earthly is sheer dullness when it comes to the sun. So it happens in estimating our spiritual goods. As long as we do not look beyond the earth, being quite content with our own righteousness, wisdom and virtue, we flatter ourselves most sweetly, and fancy ourselves all bug demigods. White With White, you get an earlier version of the Institutes. It’s missing some sections from the final, but not much (e.g. it’s missing Calvin’s defense of paedobaptism). This is translated from the French edition which is known for its lively prose. The biggest draw for this edition is its recency, only 2014. The language is very modern and flows nicely. The printed edition costs a bit more than Beverage but still a lot less than Battles. This edition will serve hobbyists well. The newness of the language will provide you with higher likelihood of finishing. Book 1, Chapter 1, Section 2 Conversely, we observe that no one ever attains clear knowledge of self unless he has first gazed upon the face of the Lord, and then turns back to look upon himself. Deeply rooted in all of us is an arrogance which persuades us that we are righteous, truthful, wise and holy. Only clear evidence that we are unrighteous, deceitful, foolish and vile will convince us of the contrary. We feel no such conviction if all we do is look upon ourselves and not also upon the Lord. He is the one and only standard with which our judgment must accord. But because hypocrisy is something to which we are all naturally prone, we are quite content with an empty show of righteousness rather than with its reality. And because there is nothing around us which is not greatly defiled, whatever is a little less grubby appears to us as purity itself, as long as we confine our attention to the limits of our own—debased—humanity. It is like the eye which, used to seeing only objects that are dark, judges things which are vaguely white or even semi-grey to be the whitest there is. An analogy based on physical sight will help us better understand how badly we misjudge our soul’s powers. If in broad daylight we look down at the ground or attend to things which are round about us, we have no trouble believing our sight is extremely sharp and keen. When, however, we look straight up at the sun, the power that served us so well on earth is dazed and dazzled by so intense a light, forcing us to admit that our ability clearly to see earthly objects is weak and feeble when it comes to gazing at the sun. This is how it is when we try to estimate our spiritual strengths. As long as we do not look beyond earth’s horizons, we are perfectly content with our own righteousness, wisdom and power. We flatter and congratulate ourselves, and are not far from thinking we are demigods!

            <content type="html">
              My journey to find the best Bible … or, ESV Pitt Minion in black goatskin review I have been reading Mark Bertrand’s Bible Design Blog for a few years now. Through his long-form writing, I have come to appreciate beautiful typography, fine craftsmanship, single-column layouts, and attention to detail in modern Bible-making. I even helped him with a website update several years ago. For the longest time, though, my reading was just that—reading. I couldn’t imagine spending so much money on a single Bible. I already had a few Bibles in the house, and there wasn’t any pressing need to buy another one. This spring, after saving up some money, I decided to invest in a premium Bible. I made a list of requirements, and I read and watched just about every review I could find on the world wide web. I was searching for the one Bible, the elusive unicorn of typographic design. I read articles about how that Bible doesn’t exist, and that I should just come to terms with the fact that I shall have to acquire a few different Bibles, each one for its own intended purpose. I became addicted to the idea of single-column design. I read all about it. I could absolutely sign Mark Ward’s Bible Typography Manifesto. Two years before the search began, my wife bought me the single-volume ESV Reader’s Bible. This Bible is relatively cheap, and gorgeous. It looks a lot more like a regular book than a dictionary or a reference book. It features a large font, single-column layout, … but its significance is in what it lacks: verse numbers, references, section headings, book introductions, etc. It’s very clean and a joy to read. I highly recommend it to anyone, and often show it off to visitors to our house. My friends are usually dismissive of the idea of a single column Bible because it doesn’t look like a real Bible. The inertia of Bible design is so tremendous that people experience a mild culture shock when looking at modern Bibles. Unfortunately, the Reader doesn’t work as the one Bible. From the start, I knew I didn’t want to become a Bible collector. I have no desire to own thousands of dollars worth of Bibles. I wanted to acquire a single Bible that I could use in many different scenarios. The primary motivation for this is that over time, you get to know your Bible, and you will learn where things are, and you can find them quickly. Professor Grant Horner is an advocate of this argument in his 10 chapters per day reading plan which I enjoy. So, let’s see if we can put together a list of priorities. The Bible must work during private reading, study, public worship, family worship, and adult Bible study with others. It must be easy to read, and yet be small enough that it’s practical to carry everywhere. It must be available in the English Standard Version. It must be pleasing to the eye and to the touch. It should be rendered in single-column layout. Since I want it to be as practical as possible, it should come with verse numbers, and section headings. References are unimportant. I was immediately captivated by Crossway’s ESV Heirloom Single Column Legacy, and Cambridge’s Clarion. Here is the Heirloom: (Photos via evangelicalbible.com) Judging by the photos in Mark Bertrand’s review of the new ESV Heirloom Legacy, the Bible looks huge. This means two things for me: it features a large, readable page, and it’s likely too big to carry everywhere. This would make a great sit-at-home-and-read-for-hours Bible, but I wouldn’t drag it to church with me. Still, the page looks amazing, single column; I love the headings on the side instead of in the text. I like that it has verse numbers and no references. It makes the text look clean. This Bible will set you back 275 USD. And here is the Clarion: (Photos via evangelicalbible.com) The Clarion is short and stout. I like the shape of it better than the Heirloom Legacy. Given its supple cover, it can be difficult to hold. It features references and a single-column text block. For some strange reason, the references are on the outside. This causes the text of the Bible to dip into the fold near the spine. Crossway’s Personal Reference Bible is also rendered in a single column setting but its references are in the middle. This is a much better solution in my opinion. Unfortunately, the Clarion seems to have problems with ghosting (also known as show-through), page curling, and while it’s smaller than the Heirloom, it’s still rather bulky. It’s about the same size as my ESV Reader’s Bible which definitely isn’t very portable. The Clarion costs about 255 USD. These two Bibles are absolutely excellent, and very expensive. If I were a collector, I think both of these should be in my collection. However, that’s not why we’re here. After dismissing the Heirloom and the Clarion, I was browsing publishers’ websites, and came across another Bible from Cambridge: the Pitt Minion. The size of this Bible is absolutely spot on: not too big (portable), and not too small (readable), not too short and not fat. I absolutely love the black goatskin edition with the red accent of a ribbon. Only problem? It’s double column. Initially, I dismissed it—almost immediately. Who would buy a double column Bible in 2017? But I kept thinking about the Pitt Minion, and kept coming back to it. I read all of Mark Bertrand’s reviews of it over and over. I think there are at least four articles on his website dedicated to the Pitt Minion. Mark’s argument for the Pitt Minion is that its columns are magic. There is something about the ratio between the column’s width, the font size, and the leading that makes it just work. This leads to high readability in spite of the tiny 6.75 font. Also, the size of the Bible is somewhere in between a pocket Bible and a medium sized Bible. This makes it unique in the kind of situations you’d want to use it in. I also greatly benefited from Matthew Everhard’s videos. Matthew is a pastor who uses a Pitt Minion has his take-it-with-you-everywhere Bible, and does a video review once a year to show how the Bible is doing with daily use. I love how the leather ages, and how the board covers soften as you use it. Once I was willing to seriously consider the double-column layout, I went back to the drawing board, as it were, and had another look at the available options. I have yet to see a Bible from R. L. Allan that I like (sorry folks). But Schuyler is a different story! Their Quentel is very intriguing, especially the Personal size version. (Photos via evangelicalbible.com) The only problem is the price. I live in Canada, and shipping is around 50 USD, and I’m probably going to get hit with import tax fees, etc. The Bible itself is about 175 USD. Evangelical Bible really needs to figure a better distribution model for their awesome Bibles. A lot more people would buy them if the shipping were cheaper (e.g. partner with Amazon). After much thought, I decided to order the Pitt Minion. Another huge reason was its price. It costs about 150 USD and I even found a great deal on Amazon, so I ended up paying about 100 USD (shipped). Compare that to the 225+ USD for the Quentel. The Pitt Minion is a steal! I opted for the black goatskin which to my eyes and heart looks the best. Just as a side note, you can get the Clarion for about that price but with a much inferior leather cover. Just look at that delicious grain! The book opens flat after a few days of handling it. Notice the red under gold art gilding on the sides of the pages. Just gorgeous. I love the red accent that the ribbons provide. (Photos by me, you can use them for any purpose) While I was waiting for it to arrive in the mail, I was rather nervous about the whole thing. But as soon as I opened the box, I was relieved and happy with the new Bible. It far exceeded by expectations. It’s even more beautiful than in the pictures. Right out of the box, the Pitt Minion doesn’t open flat. You have to handle it and read it for about a week, and then it will happily oblige. The quality of the print is exceptional. Many reviewers have said that the font is small. That might be true in the technical sense, but given the high quality of the printing, the font doesn’t feel small. Think of it like this: your normal Bible is like an old TV, it has very low resolution and unnatural colors. The Pitt Minion is your latest 4K smart TV with life-like colors. Premium Bibles stand out not just wit their binding and covers, but also with the quality of the printing. I find the font size of the Pitt Minion luxurious. Then there is the question of the double column. I remain convinced on a theoretical level that the single column layout is superior in readability. However, it does in a sense waste space in poetry sections. This leads to more bulk in the final form factor of the Bible. In practice, I don’t feel any hindrance in reading the Pitt Minion. My eye can track the words easily, and I don’t find I lose my place often when reading for extended periods of time. Moreover, there is something to be said about the Bible looking like a Bible, and double column is certainly the more traditional look. I realize this is a pretty weak argument. With Cambridge, you are purchasing a piece of history or Bible publishing history. Cambridge University Press is the world’s oldest Bible printer and publisher. They have been in continuous operation since 1591 when they published the Geneva Bible. Once you handle a premium Bible, you won’t settle for inferior quality. I have been reading from the Pitt Minion for several months now. I have carried it many places. I travelled to Europe with it. I certainly don’t baby this Bible. I fold back one side of the cover when reading, I roll it up when it’s closed, and I take it with me when going out. I find it delightful, and it’s truly a great all-around Bible.

            <content type="html">
              Why the ESV is both excellent and terrible In conservative Christian circles, the English Standard Version seems to be the Bible translation of choice. Many Calvinistic and Reformed leaders endorse this translation, and use it in their books and articles. I have personally used this translation for many years, and have enjoyed it. However, no translation is perfect. This isn’t a superficial comment meant to appease those who prefer other translations. Every translation of the Scriptures has deep flaws. You are then left with a choice of a set of flaws that you prefer. In this article, I’d like to point out why the ESV is both the best translation I know of, and a terrible one at the same time. Many people have written accounts of their churches switching to the ESV. In this article, I’ll use Kevin DeYoung’s summary. Genitives DeYoung says: [T]he ESV leaves interpretive ambiguities unresolved so that the reader or preacher or student, rather than the translator, can determine which meaning is best. [1] This sounds wonderful. We should certainly allow the Scriptures to speak as freely as possible in English. The example that DeYoung gives is that of the Greek genitive. The phrase “the love of Christ” translates the Greek agape tou Christou which is, grammatically, a nominative noun followed by a genitive noun. The love of Christ could mean the love Christ has for us, or the love we have for Christ, or both. All three are possible from the Greek and from the ESV translation. The NIV, however, translates 2 Corinthians 5:14 “For Christ’s love compels us …” This may be what the Greek phrase means (or it may not be), but the NIV has settled the matter for us—agape tou Christou means the love Christ has for us (i.e., “Christ’s love”)—and has not allowed the reader to come to his own conclusion. [2] This is a great example, and I fully agree with the decision that the ESV makes. The translation is being faithful to the original by using the same level of ambiguity. The problem, however, is that it only works in isolated examples like this one. Mark Strauss, one of the translators of the New International Version, has written an article encouraging the wider Christian community to not allow the ESV to become the standard English translation. One of his criticisms of the ESV is its treatment of Greek genitives. The ESV follows the above ambiguity of the Greek genitive too far in many cases. For example, the ESV renders Hebrews 1:3 as “he upholds the universe by the word of his power”. Strauss comments: Nonsensical (word that his power possesses?). This is an attributive genitive, meaning “his powerful word” [3] Or Romans 6:4 is translated as “we too might walk in newness of life” in the ESV. Again Strauss says that this is an attributed genitive meaning “a new life”. [4] Archaisms DeYoung praises the ESV for its commitment to literary beauty: [T]he essentially literal approach of the ESV in the book of Proverbs often sounds more, well, proverbial. The NIV often turns the aphoristic sound of proverbs into everyday conversation. Which sounds like a proverb and which sounds prosaic? The difference between the two translations is the difference between “A stitch in time saves nine” and “If you stitch something now, you’ll save yourself nine stitches later.” Proverbs are supposed to sound different from everyday speech. [5] He then compares the rendering of Proverbs 27:6 in the ESV and the NIV: ESV: “Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an enemy.” NIV: “Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses.” I agree with DeYoung’s assessment that the ESV often translates the Proverbs and Psalms better than other translations. The ESV seems to sound more reverent to my ears, and more like ancient literature. [6] The problem with the commitment to literary beauty, however, is that it often leads to awkward language, and the proliferation of archaisms. Let’s look at a few examples from Mark Strauss again: Matthew 1:18: ESV: … she was found to be with child Comment: The ESV is not literal here (the Greek idiom is “having in belly”), so this can only be classified as an archaism. Of course I would never say today my wife is “with child” unless I were trying to sound archaic and “biblical”. [7] I really can’t understand why the ESV uses this kind of language. What do we gain by refusing to say pregnant? More: Matthew 5:2 ESV: And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying: Comment: The ESV has missed the Greek idiom, which does not indicate two actions, but one—an introduction to a speech. No one speaking English would say, “The teacher opened her mouth and taught the students, saying…” [8] Prepositions and conjunctions Another area where the ESV shines is its treatment of conjunctions. Careful exegesis must depend on how clauses within an argument relate to each other. The NIV often omits these small words to make the text flow better, or sound more natural. But my argument is that it often leads to loss of meaning that is present in the original text. Here is an excellent example from Bill Mounce: Take for example Heb 6:4. The author has been saying that he wants to leave the basic, rudimentary doctrines of the Christian faith and move on to more meaty, theological matters. And then, verses 4 to 6. “It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age and who have fallen away, to be brought back to repentance” (NIV). Notice that there is no introductory conjunction in the NIV, so what is the connection of verse four to the preceding? The fact that verse four begins a new paragraph suggests that we are moving on to a new topic. And yet the careful Greek student sees that verse four begins with γάρ. Is there a connection that is obscured by the simple new paragraph? Absolutely. The flow of thought is clear. The reason that the author wants to move on to meatier matters is because of the people’s ignorance of the doctrine of necessary perseverance. And so he says that they should move on, and the reason, introduced by γάρ, is that if they do not persevere, they will never return to repentance. This is why translations like the ESV translate the γάρ: “For it is impossible.” [9] Another example comes from a rather funny and serious video by John Piper where he says you should get a Bible with all the words. Piper bemoans the likes of NIV for leaving out words from their text that they seem to not know what to do with. His text is John 4:43–45: After the two days he departed for Galilee. (For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.) So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they too had gone to the feast. (ESV) I have highlighted the two conjunctions missing in the NIV. Here, the reason for Jesus’s leaving is that there is no honor for a prophet in his home town. You cannot make that same argument from the NIV. Conclusion Every translation must make hard decisions. It is absolutely impossible to convert text in one language to another without losing some meaning. It’s true that the NIV often sounds more modern and normal. But it can be imprecise, use over-translation and under-translation, and it can obscure the flow of an argument. The ESV, on the other hand, is much more precise, tries to give you all the words, but it can often sounds too archaic, awkward, and “biblical”. Given these sets of flaws (as discussed in the introduction), I think I still prefer the ESV. I hope this illustrates the need to consult many translations during serious study. Hopefully, the diligent student of the Scriptures can indulge in at least a rudimentary understanding of Greek and Hebrew.

            <content type="html">
              Counting in your head I was born and raised in the Czech Republic. I learned to speak English and French in school. When I was 19, I moved out of the country and have been living in English-speaking countries ever since. Gradually, I have been losing the ability to speak my native language. This is especially obvious in professional settings (work, bank, government offices, etc) since I learned to be an adult while living in the UK. At this point, when speaking to strangers I feel much more comfortable speaking English. Even though my English is far from perfect. One thing that I have found over the years is that no matter how comfortable you get with another language, you will still count things in your head in your mother tongue. Counting coins, or scoops, or sheep, or anything. I am unable to count things quickly in English. Somehow the brain isn’t able to work on keeping the count in memory while incrementing the number once a second. Sequential numbers must have been burned into my mind at an early age and thus enjoy special treatment. Are you bilingual? Do you experience this, too?

            <content type="html">
              Should I finally drop QWERTY? For years now, I have wanted to switch my keyboard layout from QWERTY to something more ergonomic. QWERTY was designed to prevent typewriters from jamming. Modern computers don’t have this problem. So, why are we still using QWERTY? So, for me, it’s a given that I should switch to something else. But what? The Dvorak layout is the obvious choice. Most people who switch from QWERTY end up using Dvorak. Then there is Programmer Dvorak, and Colemak, and Programmer Colemak, and hosts of others. There are websites that allow you analyze some text, and help you determine which layout is best for you. This is of limited utility because the text you past in won’t be representative of your actually habits. Getting down to business So, how can I hack this? I installed a keylogger on my laptop, and collected data for many days. Then, I wrote a little script to analyze the data. This is mostly because analysis websites won’t let you paste in more than a few kilobytes of text. The most basic measure of how good a keyboard layout is is the percentage of keystrokes that are on the home row. The idea is that if you have to move your fingers less, you will be faster, less tired, and experience less pain. The script takes the output of the keylogger and gives you percentages of keystrokes that are on the home row for each layout. Here is what I got: qwerty: 38.69149% colemak: 35.601215% dvorak-programmer: 34.441067% dvorak: 34.441067% Wait, what? QWERTY is the most optimal keyboard layout for me? That can’t be right. Surely, there must be a bug in my code somewhere. I went over everything several times, tested my functions with dummy data, and so on. Everything seems to be correct. You can head over to GitHub and prove me wrong. I have been thinking about why I got this bizarre result. I think it’s because most of my regular typing isn’t necessarily writing prose. There is a lot of vim-style navigation (in Spacemacs, in the browser, etc), I use i3 as my window manager, … A lot of it is running commands, tab-completing things, keyboard shortcuts. Other layouts, like Colemak, are probably optimized for long-form writing. In those cases, it would probably win. But for programmer-centric typing, QWERTY is likely to be king because everything is optimized for it. What do you think?

            <content type="html">
              Teaching my son about computers Just over a year ago, my son Wyatt received his first computer for his sixth birthday. It’s a Raspberry Pi, and he has an old LCD monitor, and a kid-friendly mouse and keyboard. I purposely waited until he could read before starting to teach him about computers. He’s a pretty smart kid, reads a lot (a Harry Potter book in a weekend), and is somewhat socially awkward. Perfect for a programmer. The Raspberry Pi doesn’t have a cover on it. The first thing I did was teach him what each of the parts on the board is. This is the brain, this is the memory, this is where power comes in, etc. His very first task was to plug everything in. He had lots of fun trying to figure out where the HDMI cable goes, where the mouse and keyboard need to be plugged, etc. To this day, I teach him about debugging hardware issues by randomly unplugging cables when he’s not around. Then we turned it on. He was very excited about LED lights coming to life. Then we were greeted by a headless login screen. I made him a proper hacker handle, wjp, which he was very excited about, and I allowed him to select a password. Then, the computer was ready. We started out by learning to use bash. You type in a command and hit “enter” to run it. We explored basic unix commands like ls, cd, echo, and date. Somewhat annoyingly, the hardest concept to explain to a child is what a file and a directory are. It tooks us a few tries over many days for the concept to really sink in. I taught him to use nano to write simple text documents. He had fun writing down a list of all the superheroes he could think of, a list of countries, a list of his classmates, and so on. I installed cowsay which he loved. I taught him how to use pipes. He thought it was hilarious to pipe his superhero list to cowsay. We also experimented with espeak. Then, I installed and configured mutt for him. He has his own email address and can now communicate with his grandparents in Europe on his own. He still makes mistakes with the proper email syntax and etiquette but overall does email well. More than anything, it’s limited by his typing speed. Wyatt also loves his XMPP client, profanity. The great thing is that most people that he wants to chat with have Google phones and can interact with him without having to install anything. Annoyingly and most frustratingly, Wyatt has an iPad teacher this year at school. They do literally everything on iPads. Every single story he tells from school involves an iPad. He wants us to buy him an iPad. Many of the other parents are annoyed about this because it makes children less attentive, less creative, and much more easily bored. And I hate it because it messes up his head about Linux. No, child, ls is not an app, dammit. Shut up. But we make do. Then one blessed day, I showed him the startx command to start the X window system. He was amazed at the colors and buttons, and everything. Then, we started exploring windows, menus, and of course Minecraft. Yes, kids and their Minecraft. He likes to draw in Tuxpain, play chess, tetris, and write books in Libreoffice. A couple of weeks ago, I started teaching him basic programming with Python. He was very disappointed when he saw the kinds of programs I was going to teach him to write. He was under the impression that he was going to write a program that could turn a movie into a book. And instead, I suggested we start with “Hello world!” and leave AI for later. We started with a simple “Hello world!”. We switched from nano to micro which is very similar and has syntax highlighting. Writing a Hello world program might seem dumb to experienced programmers but it’s great at showing the novice how to connect everything together: the file, the interpreter, the command to run the program, etc. Then, we wrote a simple “Die toss” program. He was excited about it because it did something different each time, and not just say the same thing like the first program. Yesterday, we wrote a simple quiz. This time, he wrote all the code by himself with my telling him how. Print a question and answers, use raw_input() to ask for the user’s selection, and then a simple if statement to determine if they were correct. It’s amazing how easy Python makes this. answer = raw_input() if answer is &#39;b&#39;: print &#39;You are correct&#39; It reads like English. He very quickly got the concept of if statements, and started writing more and more questions. Then, of course, every family member had to take the quiz. Later that day, he told his mother that he wanted to be a programmer. He wants to write “apps”. His mother suggested that he can ask me to get him a job at Red Hat, or that he could work at Google. He scoffed at that and said he didn’t want to work on one project for a year like his Dad, and that, please, there are no computers or programmers at Google.

              Best baby advice I ever got When I became a father, I didn’t know much about babies. Fatherhood is one of those “learn on the job” situations. With a new infant in the house, one piece of advice made my life much easier. Infants cry a lot. The noise they emit is high-pitch, and designed to be irritating to adults. It’s irritating because otherwise you would just ignore the poor child. Now, to the advice: when your infant starts to scream in the middle of the night, look at the clock. Yes, look at the clock. Before you roll out of bed, before you stumble your way to the nursery, check the clock, and remember what time it is. This is the best advice I ever got. When you are sleep-deprived and tired, holding a screaming infant in the middle of the night for one minute can seem like 10. Noting the time can put things into perspective. You’ll calm down and have more patience when you realize that the eternity of constant scream is only 10 minutes. Look at the clock.

            <content type="html">
              The Marathon obsession This morning, I read a rather click-baity article about the kinds of questions that runners hate answering. Honestly, I don’t know why I clicked it — blame it on lack of coffee in my blood stream. A common theme in the article is the obsession with the marathon. When are you running your first marathon? Are you training for Boston? The writer then goes on to say that she is perfectly happy with her 5ks and 10ks. I’m also tired of the marathon obsession, but from the other end of the spectrum. The marathon distance isn’t the pinnacle of a runner’s career. You can run further. Your legs don’t magically stop working after 42.2km. The following quote from Christopher McDougall’s Born to run gives us a nice glimpse into the mindset of an ultra runner. This tiny section is one of my favorite parts in the book. “So why not marathons?” I asked Jenn when I called to interview her about the Young Guns. “Do you think you could qualify for the Olympic Trials?” “Dude, seriously,” she’d said. “The qualifying standard is 2:48. Anyone can make it.” Jenn could run a sub-three-hour marathon while wearing a string bikini and chugging a beer at mile 23-and she would, just five days after running a 50-mile trail race in the Blue Ridge Mountains. “But then what?” Jenn went on. “I hate all this hype about the marathon. Where’s the mystery? I know a girl who’s training for the Trials, and she’s got every single workout planned for the next three years! She’s doing speedwork on the track like, every other day. I couldn’t take it, man. I was supposed to run with her once at six in the morning, and I called her up at two a.m. to tell her I was shitfaced on margaritas and puh-robably not gonna make it.” Jenn didn’t have a coach or a training program; she didn’t even own a watch. She just rolled out of bed every morning, downed a veggie burger, and ran as far and as fast as she felt like, which usually turned out to be about twenty miles. Then she hopped on the skateboard she’d bought instead of a parking pass and kicked off to class at Old Dominion, where she’d recently dropped back into school and was making straight As.

              Water consumption During the 2016 edition of the Super Bowl, Colgate ran an ad highlighting our overconsumption of water during tooth-brushing. The ad is emotinally charged with images of people from poverty-ridden countries. You can watch it below. Colgate claim that you waste up to 4 gallons (15L) of water if you leave the fauset running. They intend to guilt you into conserving water. On a global scale, turning the fauset off when you brush your teeth will have a minimal effect. And not because you are only a single person making a change. Domestic consumption accounts for only about 5% of water use. If we all made a change leading to a reduction of water consumption by 50%, the overall domestic use would drop to 2.5%. And 50% is pretty dramatic. So, who is using all the water in the world? According to the ground-breaking research by the people behind the Cowspiracy documentary, 55% of water consumption in the United States goes towards animal agriculture. An immense amount of water is required to produce meat and dairy products. So instead of worrying about the running tap, we should stop eating meat and dairy. Doing so will have a much more significant impact on the world. But of course, that isn’t as feel-good as the tooth-brushing story.

            <content type="html">
              Internal Clojure libraries At work, we have a few Clojure services in production. Each service is its own leiningen project with its own dependencies. And because setting up a local maven repository is hard, each project reimplements quite a bit of logic. This duplicate code usually relates to the non-essential but still important parts of a service: logging, metrics, sentry integration, etc. Just the other day, I was getting really annoyed with this situation, and was about ready to go learn about the wonderful intricacies of Maven, when I discovered leiningen’s install command. With lein install, you can install your library as a jar and a pom to the local repository. Here, local repository means a local repository, typically in ~/.m2. Your apps can then depend on this library via the normal :dependencies list in the project file. This is all completely seamless and works well. Apparently, this command has been around for a long time. Armed with this new information, I was able to create an internal project called metrics and remove a ton of duplication. lein install also allows multiple versions of the same library to be installed at once. Simply require whatever version you need in your apps’ project.clj file. This makes developing Clojure projects without having to publish your libraries to Clojars a lot easier.

            <content type="html">
              Language choice Warning: this is a rant Recently, I have made great progress in my journey towards Haskell enlightenment. I finally see how many of the little pieces of the Haskell puzzle fit together. At this point, I feel empowered to go forth and write useful programs. I read through the source of Scotty the web framework the other day, and I was very pleasantly surprised that I understood how it works. I absolutely love Haskell. I love that it makes you think. One does not simply open a text editor and start banging at the keyboard to write a Haskell program. I love that Haskell encourages generalizations and abstractions. One of the biggest heureka moments in my journey was understanding the full implications of why a function of type a -&gt; a has a single implementation. I’m addicted to running my program for the first time (after fighting with the compiler for ages), and having it work. I think monad transformers and lenses are really clever. By many criteria, Haskell is the perfect programming language. It has taken me four years to get here. I used to get so discouraged that I took breaks for weeks or months at a time because I didn’t see the point of continuing. But I always came back. Now I have finally arrived. I would say I’m an intermediate Haskeller. Naturally, I’m thinking about writing some Haskell code at work which is going to be easy given our service-oriented architecture. I have also been playing with Purescript which is a Haskell dialect that compiles to javascript. In many ways, Purescript is a much better Haskell because it doesn’t come with the historical baggage. In speaking with my colleague who doesn’t know Purescript about introducing it into our code base, I realized the gravity of what I was asking him to learn. It sounds great to say “let’s rewrite this in purescript” and expect someone to come back from their weekend having learned enough to be dangerous when it took me four years to learn. Another great example is the open source community. If you choose Haskell for your open source project, you might be productive, safe to refactor, write little code — but how many people will be willing to learn Haskell to contribute a fix or a new feature? Many of my Haskell friends like to mock the Go programming language. Myself included at times. Mind you, the language is objectively poorly designed. The error handling, the lack of generics, the ridiculous package manager, the absurd type system, the range thing, etc. It’s almost exactly the opposite of Haskell. And yet, Go is a lot more popular than Haskell according to GitHub. Yet, there are so many amazing projects written in Go, like Docker, Influxdb, etcd, consul, prometheus, packer, and many more. Unlike Haskell, if you ask your coworkers to learn Go over the weekend, everyone will come back with a little app they built. A clearly inferior tool is used by crowds of people to build cool things. What should we conclude from this? The choice of programming language matters. Programming is a social activity. Fewer features seems to equal easier to learn. Generalization and programming language innovation seem to be out of favor. Creating software to solve real problems with blunt tools seems to be a lot more important than using a sharp axe. We’d much rather use an inferior tool whose manual we don’t have to read. We’d much rather snap a picture with our smartphone than to learn how to use a DSLR.

            <content type="html">
              Building a Redis clone in Haskell In this post, we will attempt to make a simplified clone of Redis in Haskell. Here is a set of requirements that we will aim to fullfill: get and set operations Multi-threaded Atomic Redis compatible (implement the Redis protocol) We should be able to use the redis-cli tool to connect to our server and issue commands to it. We are going to omit many features that Redis has. For example, there will be no disk persistence. We will accomplish this with about 100 lines of Haskell. Getting started: stack We are going to use stack to build our project. Stack is a new build tool for Haskell projects. We can also use it to create all the necessary files that make up a Haskell project. You can find the installation instructions here. Let’s create our project. We will call our server Redish. $ stack new Redish simple This will create a directory Redish/ with a few files in it. Redish/ LICENSE README.md Redish.cabal Setup.hs src/ Main.hs stack.yaml You can use stack to build this project and run it: $ stack build Redish-0.1.0.0: configure Configuring Redish-0.1.0.0... Redish-0.1.0.0: build Preprocessing executable &#39;Redish&#39; for Redish-0.1.0.0... [1 of 1] Compiling Main ( src/Main.hs, .stack-work/dist/x86_64-osx/Cabal-1.22.4.0/build/Redish/Redish-tmp/Main.o ) Linking .stack-work/dist/x86_64-osx/Cabal-1.22.4.0/build/Redish/Redish ... Reidhs-0.1.0.0: install Installing executable(s) in /Users/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;dirs&gt;/Redish/.stack-work/install/x86_64-osx/lts-3.2/7.10.2/bin $ stack exec Redish hello world Types Let’s start by defining our types. Redish is an in-memory database so we will need a representation of our database. For a simple key-value store, all that we need is a simple map. Let’s create a few aliases. type Value = ByteString type Key = ByteString type DB = Map Key Value Next, we will need to represent the commands that our server knows how to handle. The command data structure can be a get, a set or unknown. data Command = Get Key | Set Key Value | Unknown deriving (Eq, Show) Software transactional memory Now that we have our types in places, we need to write a few functions to operate on them. We need a way to insert data and to query our database. First things first though. Since by default everything in Haskell is immutable, how can we change the value of our in-memory database? We can’t simply overwrite the old value with the new one. The compiler won’t let us. The answer is software transactional memory, or STM for short. STM allows us to atomically change a value in our program. The atomic part is important. Many parts of the code can update this value and we have no way of knowing when and how often they might do so. STM allows us to perform atomic updates. This way any updates to our database will be run sequence even when coming from different threads. The only cost is that we have to perform any updates within the context of IO. Our DB type will be become TVar DB. The TVar type represents the mutable reference. Next, let’s create the initial value in the main function: main :: IO () main = do database &lt;- atomically $ newTVar $ fromList [(&#34;__version__&#34;, &#34;0.1.0&#34;)] This will create a Map with a key of __version__ which has the value 0.1.0. Then, it wraps that Map in a TVar and atomically assigns it to the database variable. Each time we want to write or read the database value, we have to use IO. Let’s create a helper for atomically reading this value: atomRead :: TVar a -&gt; IO a atomRead = atomically . readTVar And let’s make a function to update a value in the database. This takes a function that does the updating and runs it through the STM machinery. updateValue :: (DB -&gt; DB) -&gt; TVar DB -&gt; IO () updateValue fn x = atomically $ modifyTVar x fn Reply parsing Next, let’s talk about the Redis protocol. It’s a simple TCP scheme that looks like this: *2\r\n$3\r\nget\r\n$4\r\nname It’s a bunch of keywords and arguments separated by newlines. If we clean it up and break each thing to its own line, we get: *2 $3 get $4 name Let’s look at each line. *2 says to expect a command that has two arguments. $3 says that the first argument is three characters long. get is the three-character argument from above. $4 is the length of the second argument, and name is the value of the second argument. If you’re in the REPL provided by redis-cli, and you type get name, Redis will translate those two words into the above representation. A set command would look like this: *3 $3 set $4 name $5 honza This is what will be sent when you run set name honza. This multi-argument message is called multibulk in the Redis documentation. There are two other data types that Redis uses that will interest us: the OK and the error. When Redis needs to tell you that it accepted request and everything went smoothly, it simply responds with +OK. When Redis needs to indicate an error, it replies with -ERR something went wrong (where “something went wrong” is the message). This format is very simple and actually very effective. When we listen on a socket for incoming messages, we have a look at the very first character. + tells us that it’s OK, - signals and error, and * tells us to keep reading for commands. We incrementally read from the socket only as much data as the protocol tells us. In this section, we will write a parser for multibulk messages. We will use the amazing attoparsec library for this. The following code is heavily influenced by the Hedis library. Credit goes to Falko Peters. Thanks! A multibulk message is called a reply in Redis lingo. Let’s make a type for it. data Reply = Bulk (Maybe ByteString) | MultiBulk (Maybe [Reply]) deriving (Eq, Show) A Bulk reply is a simple string like get or name above. MultiBulk is the whole message. Let’s also write a function that attempts to convert a Reply to a Command. parseReply :: Reply -&gt; Maybe Command parseReply (MultiBulk (Just xs)) = case xs of [Bulk (Just &#34;get&#34;), Bulk (Just a)] -&gt; Just $ Get a [Bulk (Just &#34;set&#34;), Bulk (Just a), Bulk (Just b)] -&gt; Just $ Set a b _ -&gt; Just Unknown parseReply _ = Nothing Next, let’s use attoparsec to write a parser for the Reply data type. replyParser :: Parser Reply replyParser = choice [bulk, multiBulk] Our replyParser will try to match either a bulk or a multiBulk. Let’s implement those: bulk :: Parser Reply bulk = Bulk &lt;$&gt; do len &lt;- char &#39;$&#39; *&gt; signed decimal &lt;* endOfLine if len &lt; 0 then return Nothing else Just &lt;$&gt; take len &lt;* endOfLine multiBulk :: Parser Reply multiBulk = MultiBulk &lt;$&gt; do len &lt;- char &#39;*&#39; *&gt; signed decimal &lt;* endOfLine if len &lt; 0 then return Nothing else Just &lt;$&gt; count len replyParser First, the parsers look at the first character to see what kind of message it is. If it starts with a $, it’s a bulk. If it starts with a *, it’s multibulk. Then, it reads as many characters from the input as the length indicator said. In the case of multibulk, it recurses because it can contain bulk messages. You can now run: &gt; parse replyParser &#34;*2\r\n$3\r\nget\r\n$4\r\nname\r\n&#34; &gt; (MultiBulk (Just [(Bulk (Just &#34;get&#34;)), (Bulk (Just &#34;name&#34;))])) Networking At this point, we have our data structures ready and we know how to parse incoming requests into them. Now we need to work on the networking part. Let’s teach our program how to listen on a socket and parse incoming text into something useful. Let’s change our main function to this: main :: IO () main = withSocketsDo $ do database &lt;- atomically $ newTVar $ fromList [(&#34;__version__&#34;, version)] sock &lt;- listenOn $ PortNumber 7777 putStrLn &#34;Listening on localhost 7777&#34; sockHandler sock database This is pretty straight-forward. Ask for a socket and then listen on it. When something happens on the socket, run the function socketHandler. Let’s implement that next: sockHandler :: Socket -&gt; TVar DB -&gt; IO () sockHandler sock db = do (handle, _, _) &lt;- accept sock hSetBuffering handle NoBuffering hSetBinaryMode handle True _ &lt;- forkIO $ commandProcessor handle db sockHandler sock db Given a socket and a reference to a mutable database, we can get a handle and start processing requests. For each new connection, run forkIO which will do all this work of parsing and responding on a new lightweight thread. At the end, we simply recurse to accept new work. The commandProcessor function does the heavy lifting here, so let’s write that next. commandProcessor :: Handle -&gt; TVar DB -&gt; IO () commandProcessor handle db = do reply &lt;- hGetReplies handle replyParser let command = parseReply reply runCommand handle command db commandProcessor handle db This function runs the replyParser we wrote earlier. It uses a very clever function called hGetReplies which we will look at in a minute. It will read as much data as necessary from the handle to get an instance of Reply. We then convert that reply to a command and run it. hGetReplies :: Handle -&gt; Parser a -&gt; IO a hGetReplies h parser = go S.empty where go rest = do parseResult &lt;- parseWith readMore parser rest case parseResult of Fail _ _ s -&gt; error s Partial{} -&gt; error &#34;error: partial&#34; Done _ r -&gt; return r readMore = S.hGetSome h (4*1024) The parseWith function does partial matching. When it can’t parse anything, it will use the readMore function to get more data and try again. The readMore function uses the handle to read more data. Once the parser can match something, we are done. Running commands Once we have a command, we can run it! runCommand :: Handle -&gt; Maybe Command -&gt; TVar DB -&gt; IO () runCommand handle (Just (Get key)) db = do m &lt;- atomRead db let value = getValue m key S.hPutStr handle $ S.concat [&#34;$&#34;, valLength value, crlf, value, crlf] where valLength :: Value -&gt; ByteString valLength = pack . show . S.length runCommand handle (Just (Set key value)) db = do updateValue (insert key value) db S.hPutStr handle ok runCommand handle (Just Unknown) _ = S.hPutStr handle $ S.concat [&#34;-ERR &#34;, &#34;unknown command&#34;, crlf] runCommand _ Nothing _ = return () When the command is a get, we read the DB atom. Then we construct a bulk reply and write it to the handle. The bulk reply is in the same format as our messages above: $5\r\nhonza\r\n. The getValue function is a lookup function that returns “null” if a value can’t be found. getValue :: DB -&gt; Key -&gt; Value getValue db k = findWithDefault &#34;null&#34; k db When the command is a set, we use our updateValue function from above and write the ok to the handle. The ok variable is just +OK\r\n. When the command is unknown, we write an error to the handle. Compiling and running You can now build your program with $ stack build And run it with $ stack exec Redish Listening on localhost 7777 To test it out, you can connect to it with the redis-cli tool: $ redis-cli -p 7777 127.0.0.1:7777&gt; set name honza OK 127.0.0.1:7777&gt; get name &#34;honza&#34; You can test the performance with something silly, like: $ time redis-cli -r 10000 get name Conclusion You can see the finished product on GitHub. Feedback is welcome, so are questions.

            <content type="html">
              Markdown editors are an anti-pattern In the last year or so, there seems to have been an explosion of markdown editors and markdown previewers. A quick Google search reveals so, many of them. The App Store is also full of these kinds of apps, promising you unrivaled productivity and writing bliss. But, I would submit to you that all of these apps miss the point of markdown. From the markdown project page: The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. The syntax (or lack thereof) of the markdown format is so simple that there is no need to “preview” the result. A heading looks like a heading. A list looks like a list. This is a prime example of creating a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist. The reason why these apps are popular and people buy them has less to do with the need to preview markdown and more with the hisperized culture of writing for the web.

              Single vs Many Programming Languages Junior programmers will often ask, “Which language should I use?”, “Which programming language is the best?”, and when they discover this new hip programming language that’s meant to solve all of their scaling problems, they get in your face and mock you for not using it for every single task. They will write blog posts titled “X language for Y programmers” in hopes of converting the masses to their newfound toy. Smug senior programmers will laugh at the junior programmers and say that you should learn a great many different languages to expand your horizons. A single language cannot possibly suffice in this day and age. Each language has its own set of libraries, each is better suited for a particular task. Learning new languages will make you a better developer overall. Plus, marketing yourself as an X language developer limits your choice of employer. Business people will have yet another approach. Their product is obviously written in some language or another so they need developer who can speak that language. Their platform is growing like crazy so they put up job posts screaming “X language developer needed!”. This creates a perceived demand for a certain kind of developer. Developer will start to feel the need to learn this newly popular technology and start by reading a “X language for Y programmers” post and thus completing the circle.

            <content type="html">
              How to use piggieback in vim-fireplace to hack cljs (That’s quite a title, isn’t it?) If you’re using vim to write Clojure code, chances are that you’re using Tim Pope’s vim-fireplace plugin. It’s really great. It stars an nREPL session in the background for you and lets you evaluate a form inside of vim. It’s super fast because it keeps the session around and it’s one of my favorite things about writing Clojure. Recently, vim-fireplace received support for piggieback. Piggieback is a layer on top of nREPL that gives you support for ClojureScript. This is really great because it gives you the ability to evaluate ClojureScript code in vim just like your normal Clojure code. Alright, here is how to set it up: project.clj (defproject pig &#34;0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&#34; :description &#34;FIXME: write this!&#34; :url &#34;http://example.com/FIXME&#34; :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure &#34;1.5.1&#34;] [com.cemerick/piggieback &#34;0.1.3&#34;]] :plugins [[lein-cljsbuild &#34;1.0.2&#34;]] :repl-options {:nrepl-middleware [cemerick.piggieback/wrap-cljs-repl]} :source-paths [&#34;src&#34;] :cljsbuild { :builds [{:source-paths [&#34;src&#34;] :compiler { :target :nodejs :optimizations :simple}}]}) Pretty standard stuff. We’re using the lein-cljsbuild plugin for automatic compilation, we set up the source path and a nodejs compile target. Now you simply open a .cljs file and you can do your usual vim-fireplace magic. The first cpr (reload current buffer) command will connect to an nREPL instance and initialize the piggieback wrapper.

            <link href="https://honza.ca/2013/12/lisp-parentheses"/>

            <content type="html">
              Lisp parentheses Perhaps the number one reason why people are afraid to try Lisp or don’t like it is the huge amounts of parentheses cluttering up the code. It’s said to be hard to read the code when it’s full of parentheses. Any experienced Lisp programmer will tell you that the parentheses disappear fairly early on. After a while, you hardly notice them as something annoying. In fact, going back to C-family languages will make you feel like you need to type all kinds of crazy punctuation. While Clojure technically doesn’t use significant whitespace like Python, in reality, careful identation is crucial to writing clear code. (defn crop-photo [user photo] (when (authenticated? user) (when (admin? user) (crop photo)))) In this snippet, there are four levels of indentation, four nested expressions. It’s easy to quickly scan this function guess what it does. When a user is authenticated and when they are an admin, crop the photo. If any of the when expressions return a falsy value, the whole function will return nil. All of this is possible because Clojure uses prefix notation. This means that the first element in the (…) form is the name of the function. Therefore, you only need to scan the beginnings of lines to see what functions are being called. Also, you never have to pay attention to closing parentheses because they are all sitting together at the end of the function. In Clojure, it’s also idiomatic to put function arguments on new lines and align them. (or (admin? user) (staff? user)) In this example, the or macro usually takes two arguments. We put each argument on its own line and align them. This way it’s visually clear what the code does. Finally, when writing Clojure code, you rarely have to worry about matching up your parentheses. This is a job for your text editor. Inserting a new expression usually involves typing the ( key and having its friend ) inserted for you.

            <content type="html">
              Masterless Saltstack This is a simple guide on how to use Saltstack, the configuration manager, in masterless mode. In most scenarios, you will use a Saltstack master to control many minions. Saltstack contains a lot of utilities to check the state of minions, gather information about them, etc. However, if you are working on a small, single-server application, Saltstack’s master-minion setup might be overkill. You can indeed use a single minion. A bit of setup first Your project will need two directories for Saltstack’s files. pillar/ salt/ The salt directory will contain the scripts that are responsible for setting up a particular part of your server, e.g. nginx, postgresql, etc. pillar on the other hand will contain the configuration value for each environment that your app will run in. So, you might have a staging and a production environment set up there. Each of these directories needs a top.sls file which is what’s loaded first. For fun, let’s just install vim into a production environment. pillar/ top.sls production.sls salt/ top.sls vim.sls Salt The salt/top.sls file will have a case-expression-like structure, matching on hostnames of your app. base: &#39;production&#39;: - vim Note that sls files use YAML syntax. Here we are installing vim in the production hostname. The salt/vim.sls file will look something like this: vim: pkg: - installed This simply says that we want the vim package installed. Saltstack will automatically detect your package manager (i.e. apt-get, yum, etc). Pillar The pillar/top.sls file has the same structure as the main file from the salt directory. base: &#39;production&#39;: - production When the production hostname is detected, use the production.sls file for configuration. You can put just about anything you want to the production.sls file, be it the servers IP address or the SMTP settings. Where to put things After you’ve installed Saltstack on your server, you should copy or symlink the salt/ and pillar/ directories to the /srv directory /srv/salt /srv/pillar Running it Once the configuration files are in place, you can run the minion’s provisioning command to get everything configured and installed. $ salt-call --local state.highstate Don’t ask me why it’s like this. Makes no sense. Saltstack will run everything and then report what happened during the run.

              How to compile vim … from source when you’re using the homebrew-provided Python. If you have installed Python via homebrew, your vim will compile fine but when a plugin tries to use Python to do some its work, vim will crash like this: Not pretty. Apparently, this is because vim will use the first Python it can find which in our case the homebrew-provided one. You can of course get a pre-compiled version and ignore this. But I like to use the latest version of vim and with the 7.4 beta, I have been doing that a lot lately… So, what is one to do? We have to fix the PATH. Here is the script that I use to recompile vim. This goes in the root of the vim project. export PATH=/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/bin ./configure \ --enable-perlinterp \ --enable-pythoninterp \ --enable-rubyinterp \ --enable-cscope \ --with-features=huge make There and vim is now compiled properly with Python support that won’t make you cry. Thanks to Steve Losh for pointing me in the right direction on this.

            <id>https://honza.ca/2013/07/how-i-back-up-my-laptop</id>

            <content type="html">
              How I back up my laptop For the longest time, I was using Time Machine to keep copies of my files. I don’t remember ever wishing I could go back in time and retrieve an older version of a file. What does keep me up at night though is forever losing all of the pictures of our kids because my hard drive failed. I also don’t particularly like tools like Time Machine, Carbon Copy Cloner or SuperDuper. They are some kind of GUI app that does stuff, and I like my unix tools. Here are my requirements for a good backup solution: Incremental - that means don’t overwrite older backups and don’t back up everything every time Efficient storage - I shouldn’t need 10 TB to keep a few backups of my hard drive Bootable - if my hard drive fails or laptop gets stolen, I want to be able to back to work quickly When you do some research into this, you will see mostly suggesting rsync. It can copy your entire drive and does smart, incremental backups. Except it overwrites stuff and you only get to keep the latest copy. Enter bup. Bup is simply amazing. It’s based on git and it gives you automatic incremental, deduplicated, shared backups. Free and open source. Backing up huge virtual machines? It only backs up what changed, not the whole file. Multiple copies of the same stuff on your hard drive? Only needs to store one copy. Have a look at their documentation for more information about how it works and what the benefits are. The way you use bup is by creating a tar archive stream of all your data and sending it to bup on stdin. Bup takes it, chunks, deduplicates it and stores in a git repo. The canonical example goes like this: tar -cvf - /etc | bup split -n local-etc The -n flag just allows you to name your backup. Next, we have to figure out how to tar up our entire drive. This can be a little tricky because there are some special files which we don’t want to copy over. After much trial, error and googling, I came up with the following list of exclusions. Note that this only applies to OS X. .Spotlight-*/ .Trashes /afs/* /automount/* /cores/* /dev/* /Network/* /private/tmp/* /private/var/run/* /private/var/spool/postfix/* /private/var/vm/* /Previous Systems.localized /tmp/* /Volumes/* */.Trash Save this to excludes.txt and then use this tar command: $ tar -cvf - / -X excludes.txt | bup split -n backup This takes about 1-2h on my system (128GB SSD, 500GB 5400rpm external). Subsequent backups take a lot less time. As far as actual backup goes, we’re done. How do you restore? The nice thing about bup is that it stores your backups in a git repository. This means that you can go back in history and decide from which point in time you’d like to restore. Bup allows you to spit out a tar file like this: $ bup join backup -o backup.tar This will again take some time and use quite a bit of resources (git will eat your RAM and CPU - a 6GB git process anyone?). Once that is done, you can extract the tar to a drive that can be booted into. This can be the internal drive on a new computer or a GUID-partitioned external drive. Once extracted, you just have to bless the data to make it bootable: $ sudo bless -folder /System/Library/CoreServices Then, you should reboot your Mac while holding down the Option key. This will show you the boot order menu and allow you to specify where you’d like to boot from. Of course, you should wrap all of this in a script and run it periodically.

            <content type="html">
              When HN gets in the way Reading stuff online can become addictive. So addictive, in fact, that it can negatively affect your productivity as a programmer. Most of us go to Hacker News or Reddit to get our dose of news. We justify it by saying that it’s research or that we are trying to stay current in the community. Whatever your excuse, you know you have a problem when you check Hacker News every ten minutes just to see if anything new and awesome has been added. “Close Hacker News and open a f***ing book.” – Steve Losh in this talk. Maybe you have already gotten over the initial self-denial and you have added some entries to your /etc/hosts file to keep yourself from constantly going to those sites. That’s all well and good but I think we can do better. You’ve already opened the tab and you are now staring at a blank error page. Why not put something more useful there? Me, I like to learn new things. There are way too many things I’d like to learn. Why not show a list of things I’d like to learn and allow me to click through to the website? I have installed nginx on my machine and set up a simple static page with a few links things like Learn You a Haskell for Great Good or Steve Losh’s Learn Vimscript the Hardway. Now every time I go to HN, I see those links and am reminded that I wanted to spend some time learning those things… Steps Install nginx. brew install nginx or sudo apt-get install nginx or whatever might apply to you. Stick this in your nginx.conf: worker_processes 1; http { include mime.types; default_type application/octet-stream; keepalive_timeout 65; server { listen 443; server_name news.ycombinator.com; ssl on; ssl_certificate /usr/local/etc/nginx/server.crt; ssl_certificate_key /usr/local/etc/nginx/server.key; location / { root html; index index.html index.htm; } } server { listen 80; server_name reddit.com; location / { root html; index index.html index.htm; } } } If any of the sites you are blocking are served over SSL, you will need to get a self-signed certificate. This is a one time setup and doesn’t really take that long to do. $ openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out server.crt -keyout server.key $ chmod 600 server.key Now you just place those two files to the locations referenced in the above nginx.conf file and restart nginx. And here is how you can make Chrome stop complaining about your self-signed certificate (source). In the address bar, click the little lock with the X. This will bring up a small information screen. Click the button that says “Certificate Information.” Click and drag the image to your desktop. It looks like a little certificate. Double-click it. This will bring up the Keychain Access utility. Enter your password to unlock it. Be sure you add the certificate to the System keychain, not the login keychain. Click “Always Trust,” even though this doesn’t seem to do anything. After it has been added, double-click it. You may have to authenticate again. Expand the “Trust” section. “When using this certificate,” set to “Always Trust” That’s it! Close Keychain Access and restart Chrome, and your self-signed certificate should be recognized now by the browser. Conclusion Hopefully, this will be helpful to you and nudge you every now and then to learn something you’ve been putting off.

              I hate your code When starting to work on an existing codebase, I often find myself in a state of despair. The code doesn’t make any sense, the programmers must have all been idiots, why on earth would they do it like this, … I hate everything about the code. I spend hours going through it, thinking to myself, I would have done a much better job writing this and making a list of changes that must be done in order for the project to conform to my standards. But then, when I have spent enough time reading everything, something clicks in my mind. I see what the authors were trying to do and everything makes sense. It’s actually kind of clever. And I feel dumb. Every time.

            <content type="html">
              Who are the weak Christians? When you look around you while sitting in a church service, you will generally have a sense of who is who. You know who the nice people are, who the grumps are and who always causes trouble. You know the people who always ask silly questions, and you know the people that always seem to know what to say when you are helpless. You might have an idea of who is a strong Christian and who has ways to go. We all do. What does the Bible say about strong and weak Christians? In Romans 14, Paul gives us an answer to this question. If you are anything like me, his answer might surprise you: As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions. One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables. (Romans 14:1-2, ESV) Paul is saying here that the weaker Christian is the kind of person who has lesser freedom in Christ. They think that those who eat meat aren’t real Christians and they need to learn. They are bound by their conscience to obey additional rules to honor the Lord. This is very interesting because our natural inclination is to see those with a zeal for good, Christian rules as more mature in the faith. If you are exhorting others to do this and stop doing that, you are more likely to be viewed as a mature Christian. However, the Bible says that the opposite is true. Strong Christians have a greater freedom in the gospel than their weaker brothers. Their conscience doesn’t prevent them from doing certain things. Their legalistic tendencies are minimal. A great example before you go: in Acts 10, Peter is told to eat unclean animals. These animals were unclean according to the law which was now fulfilled in Jesus. But Peter said, “By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean.” (Acts 10:14, ESV) Peter’s conscience is weak and needs to be redeemed by the Holy Spirit. This is a great example of a weak person becoming stronger in the faith.

The primary factor in looking good should be the choice of a good font at a comfortable size, and a syntax coloring theme that you like. And that is not something specific to an editor. Editors like Emacs and vi have almost no UI! If Emacs is configured right, the only UI it has is the modeline and the minibuffer. Vivek Haldar in New Frontiers In Text Editing

              Google plus adoption Google+ has been the target of numerous jokes in the tech community. Many blogs claim that adoption has been minimal and that the product isn’t appealing to common users over alternatives such as Facebook. I have noticed quite the opposite is true. Many of my extended family in the Czech Republic have somewhat recently acquired new Android devices. One by one, they have added me to their circles on Google+. My stream is now full of pictures that my parents, aunts and uncles took with their phones. Google uploads those pictures as soon as you take them and reminds you to share them. This interface is so simple that even the average joe can share their content online. The way I see it, Google is doing something right.

            <content type="html">
              Building a Lisp to Javascript compiler In this post, I’m going to show you how I made a Lisp to Javascript compiler. I really enjoy programming in Clojure but have often thought that the JVM isn’t always the best platform for scripts due to the slow JVM start-up. So, I decided to implement a simple version of Clojure that compiles to Javascript and can be run on top of nodejs. Compilers are notoriously hard to understand and therefore make for great mind-bending exercises. Exactly my idea of weekend fun. What we are going to do There are tons of Lisp to Javascript compilers out there. What makes mine special? I’m using a PEG grammar to parse the source code. Once it’s parsed, I turn the result into a Parser API compatible AST. The AST is then passed to escodegen which turns it into well-formatted Javascript. This is great because I don’t have to worry about the particulars of Javascript syntax. Escodegen takes care of inserting semicolons where appropriate, etc. and everything looks clean and consistent. It’s nice because the parsing is decoupled from the source code emission. You can completely remove the Javascript generation part and use some other software to do that. Lisp basics If you are familiar with Lisp, you can skip this section. Lisp source code is made up of s-expressions. An s-expression is a list whose first element is a function and the rest are the arguments to that function. (greet &#34;honza&#34;) This is a list with two items. greet is the name of the function and “honza” is the argument. In other languages, this might be represented as greet(“honza”). Lisp uses s-expressions for everything, including function definitions, if statements, assignments, binary expressions, etc. (def name &#34;honza&#34;) ;; define a variable &#34;name&#34; and assign &#34;honza&#34; to it (+ 1 2) ;; add 1 and 2 and return the result ;; If the name variable is equal to &#34;honza&#34;, print &#34;hey honza&#34;, otherwise, ;; just print &#34;hey stranger&#34;. (if (= name &#34;honza&#34;) (print &#34;hey honza&#34;) (print &#34;hey stranger&#34;)) ;; Function definition; it takes one parameter called &#34;name&#34;. (def greet (fn [name] (println &#34;hello&#34; name))) In Lisp, a function body can have multiple s-expression but only the last one is returned. There is no return keyword in Lisp. Binary operators and things like the if keyword are actually functions that return values. The mighty PEG Every PEG grammar starts with the program directive. This is where the parser will start parsing. program = s:sexp+ &#34;\n&#34;* { return { type: &#39;Program&#39;, body: s };} A Lisp program consists of one or more s-expressions, optionally followed by a newline. The list of one or more s-expressions is stored in the variable s. We then return a Javascript object with two properties: type and body. Since we are at the top level, we return it as a type of Program, and our body will be made up of the matched s-expressions. The syntax is a little weird at first but you get used to it. Fairly simple stuff. If you tried to compile this grammar into a parser, it would fail because we didn’t tell it what an s-expression looks like. sexp = _ a:atom _ { return a; } / _ l:list _ { return l; } / _ v:vector _ { return v; } / _ o:object _ { return o; } OK, so an s-expression is either an atom, a list, a vector or an object. Each of these can be preceded and followed by any amount of whitespace. Cool, that’s simple enough. Except now we have to define what all those things are. Let’s start with the atom: atom = d:[0-9]+ _ { return {type: &#39;Literal&#39;, value: numberify(d)}; } / &#39;&#34;&#39; d:(!&#39;&#34;&#39; sourcechar)* &#39;&#34;&#39; _ { return {type: &#39;Literal&#39;, value: makeStr(d) }} / s:[-+/\*_&lt;&gt;=a-zA-Z\.!]+ _ { return {type: &#39;Identifier&#39;, name: s.join(&#34;&#34;)};} So, an atom can be a list of one or more digits, a string or a valid identifier. In the digit directive, you will notice that we are assigning the number to the d variable. This will contain a list of all of the matched numbers. We then concatenate them and parse them into an integer. That’s what the numberify function does. A number or a string is a literal value so we return it as such. An identifier is a variable name, so we return it as such, too. Next up, vectors and objects: vector = &#34;[]&#34; { return {type: &#39;ArrayExpression&#39;, elements: []}; } / _ &#34;[&#34; _ a:atom+ _ &#34;]&#34; _ { return {type: &#39;ArrayExpression&#39;, elements: a};} / _ &#34;[&#34; _ o:object+ _ &#34;]&#34; _ { return {type: &#39;ArrayExpression&#39;, elements: o};} object = &#34;{}&#34; { return {type: &#39;ObjectExpression&#39;, properties: []}; } / _ &#34;{&#34; _ a:atom+ _ &#34;}&#34; _ { return makeObject(a); } Continuing in the same vein, a vector is either an empty array, an array with at least one atom in it, or an array with at least one object in it. The makeObject function will take a pair by pair from the array and take the first item in the pair and turn it into an object key and set as its value to the second item in the pair. If the number of elements in the array isn’t divisible by 2, it will yell at you. Next up, lists. Now, lists are special because the first item is the name of a function. This gives us the opportunity to define some built-in functions that would otherwise be really tricky to define. list = &#34;()&#34; { return []; } / _ &#34;(&#34; _ s:sexp+ _ &#34;)&#34; _ { if (first(s).name === &#39;def&#39;) { return { type: &#39;VariableDeclaration&#39;, declarations: [{ type: &#39;VariableDeclarator&#39;, id: s[1], init: s[2].expression? s[2].expression : s[2] }], kind: &#39;var&#39; }; } if (first(s).name === &#39;fn&#39;) { return { type: &#39;FunctionExpression&#39;, id: null, params: s[1].elements ? s[1].elements : s[1], body: { type: &#39;BlockStatement&#39;, body: init(rest(rest((s)))).concat(returnStatement(last(rest(s)))) } }; } if (Object.keys(builtins).indexOf(first(s).name) &gt; -1) { return builtins[first(s).name](rest(s)); } return processCallExpression(s); } OK, there is quite a bit here, so let’s step through it. A list can be an empty list a list of at least one s-expression If it’s an empty list, we just return an empty array. If it’s a list of s-expressions, we check for other things. We look at the first element and see what its name is. It can be either: def - variable declaration fn - an anonymous function a built-in function (if, +, list, etc.) other function (user defined) The only thing left is the definition of whitespace _ = [\n, ]* Zero or more of the following characters: newline, comma and space. Obstacles When converting the parsed source code to the Parser API tree, I hit a few obstacles. It turns out that Lisp and Javascript don’t map perfectly to each other and therefore some post-processing is needed. Statement vs expression In Lisp, everything is an expression. In Javascript, there are both expressions and statements. The hardest part is the fact that a function call can be both a statement and an expression depending on how it’s used. So you can’t represent it the same way every time. I wrote a function that takes a list which represents an s-expression (the first element is a function call, the rest are the parameters). function processCallExpression(s) { var callee = first(s), args = rest(s) args = map(function(s) { if (s.expression &amp;&amp; s.expression.type === &#39;CallExpression&#39;) { return s.expression; } else { return s; } }, args); return { type: &#39;ExpressionStatement&#39;, expression: { type: &#39;CallExpression&#39;, callee: callee, &#39;arguments&#39;: args } } } This will check if any of the arguments passed to the function are also function calls. If it’s a nested function call, it’s placed in the AST as a CallExpression, otherwise it’s a CallExpression inside a ExpressionStatement. The PEG parser can’t detect this because it’s context free - each node only knows about itself. Implicit return In Lisp, the last s-expression in a function’s body is implicitly returned. You don’t need to denote this with a return statement, it’s built-in. Again, we need to do some more processing. If we are processing a function declaration, we need to check its body and wrap the last expression in a ReturnStatement. If is an expression in Lisp The if statement in Lisp is an expression, just like a function call or anything else. This means that the expression in any of the two branches is effectively returned to the caller. This means that we need to add an extra wrapper around the statement and wrap each of the branch-expressions in a return statement. Like this: // this if (n === 0) { return &#34;it&#39;s zero&#34;; } else { return &#34;it&#39;s more than zero&#34;; } // becomes (function() { if (n === 0) { return &#34;it&#39;s zero&#34;; } else { return &#34;it&#39;s more than zero&#34;; } })(); Standard library A lisp would be no fun without some fun functional programming functions. I have started working on a standard library for our lisp. It lives in a file called lib.js. This file includes functions that are accessible from any program that you write. For example: function nth(list, n) { if (list.length &amp;&amp; list.length + 1 &lt; n) { return null; } return list[n]; } function first(list) { return nth(list, 0); } And much more. Putting it all together Here is how it all comes together: Use peg.js to compile the grammar into a parser Take the parser and append to it the compiler program The compiler program is the command line utility that decides how your program should be compiled, it parsers CLI flags, etc. It can return the AST instead of Javascript, it can uglify the resulting Javascript, etc. You can use the result like so $ ./inertia sample.clj And it will print the resulting Javascript to stdout. What the compiler program will also do is prepend the compiled Javascript with the standard library. It simply reads the standard library code from the lib.js file and prepends it. Conclusion This has certainly been a fun exercise for me. You can check out the finished product on GitHub.

            <content type="html">
              Software Engineering Interviews If you find yourself interviewing for a software engineering position today, you can be 90 percent sure that you will be asked to solve some programming puzzles. We’ve all been there. You come to the office for an interview, spend a few minutes talking about the job and you, and then the inevitable hits: programming puzzles and quizzes. You are asked to solve nonsensical, irrelevant, theoretical problems on the spot while the interviewer waits. These problems in no way represent the actual work for which you’re interviewing. How do you detect a palindrome? What is the worst-case performance of the quicksort algorithm? How do you find depth of a binary tree? These are all utter nonsense. If your cutting-edge application needs to detect palindromes, I’m pretty sure you have bigger problems than you think. All of these can be easily solved after a few minutes of research on the Internet. I get especially annoyed at these things because my mind doesn’t work well in this area. I don’t like to solve unrealistic problems. My nonsense detector kicks in and I can’t concentrate. Instead, ask me if I know how to debug messaging queue issues, how I like to set up a new server, how I like to run my Django apps, how I’d solve a specific problem you’re having, etc. Have me work on your product alongside someone in your company. Get to know me. I can program. I’m good at what I do. I’m just not good at those stupid puzzles. It’s not that I don’t like to think. I’m learning Haskell and I think I have understood monads (don’t ask me to explain them to you though). I like parsers and parser combinators. That stuff is hard to understand and takes some serious alone time to grok. I’m sure you can find a person out there who is the inverse of me. They love puzzles and excel at them. They get to the final round of Google Jam. I don’t. Not even close. But they are terrible programmers. Who would you rather hire? Every now and then I get this idea that I’ll go and learn a whole bunch of puzzles and quizzes so I can wow the next interviewer. But then I inevitably start to feel dishonest and drop the whole thing. How to interview someone Find a small problem in your code base. Give them access to your Git repository. Assign the ticket to them. Explain why it’s a problem and suggest a few possible solutions. Have them work on it either alone or alongside one of your developers. This gives your team the chance to get to know this potential hire and see if they would be a good fit. This is how I interviewed at Amara and it was great. I’d like to end with a brilliant Zach Holman quote on interview: I think programming riddles, games, and brain teasers are a great way to hire. First one to say “fuck this” and walk out gets the job.

            <content type="html">
              International families I’m from the Czech republic. My wife is from Canada. We got married in Canada. Our son was born in the United Kingdom. Our daughter was born in Canada. Both of our children are by birth Czech and Canadian at the same time. We want our children to be able to prove both of those citizenships and the following is the process. Our son Our son Wyatt was born in the UK. He has a British birth certificate but is not a British citizen. In order to travel out of the UK, he had to get a passport. Because we now live in Canada, we decided it would make more sense to get the Canadian one done first. In order for someone without a Canadian birth certificate to get a Canadian passport, you need to get a proof of citizenship. This is a piece of paper that Wyatt will have to use for the rest of his life to prove his Canadian citizenship instead of a birth certificate like all normal Canadians. So, to get a passport, you first need a proof of citizenship. Wyatt is a Canadian citizen because his mother is Canadian. In order to get the proof of citizenship, you need to send a superlegalized British birth certificate to the Canadian government and include the mother’s birth certificate to prove the she is Canadian. Super what? Superlegalization is a process whereby Canada and the UK agree to authorize the use of each other’s legal documents. Wyatt’s British birth certificate must be stamped by a Canadian embassy in the UK to say that this is in fact a legal document issued by the United Kingdom. Also, along with his application we had to send in our marriage certificate. Once he’s obtained the proof of citizenship, we can apply for a passport. Fortunately, the Canadian government is nice enough to allow you to apply for the proof of citizenship and the passport on one application. We had his passport in a few weeks. Now we are living in Canada and want to get him all the papers he needs to be a true Czech citizen. This means that we need to have his British birth certificate legalized by the UK, then translated into Czech by a government-approved translator, then approved by the Ministry of Interior of the Czech republic and then we can apply for a Czech birth certificate. Of course, the application requires us to send in our marriage certificate. Since we got married in Canada, we have a Canadian marriage certificate. This means that we need to have to superlegalized, translated into Czech and approved by the Ministry. More fees and translators aren’t cheap. Once he has a Czech birth certificate, he needs to apply for a birth number which isn’t unlike a social security number except it’s derived from your date of birth. Our daughter Our daughter Eliška was born in Canada. This means she can fortunately get a Canadian passport without any issues. She is a real Canadian like most people and doesn’t need to have any special paperwork to prove that she is. Piece of cake. When it comes to the Czech side of things, it’s seems it’s much more complicated than with our son. First, she needs to apply for a proof of Czech citizenship. Her Canadian birth certificate needs to be superlegalized, translated and approved. This is fortunately done at the Czech embassy in Ottawa and you are allowed to translate the document yourself and they will verify it for you. One of the forms that you need to send in with the application requires you to have your signature verified by a notary. No big deal, right? Well, good luck finding a notary in Canada who speaks Czech and is willing to notarize your signature. I was emailing back and forth with the embassy that they allowed me to photocopy my ID and take that to the notary instead. I’ll sign it in front of him and he can verify my identity and signature. I’ll send this in along with the application. The application process takes about 4-6 months according to their website. I have yet to apply for this. But when it comes back, we will have to apply for a Czech birth certificate and a birth number. More forms, more fees, more superlegalization, etc. Conclusion No matter what you do, do not romanticize international families. It’s not all that fun all the time…

            <content type="html">
              Calvin on predestination Book 3, chapter 23 When Paul declares that we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:4), he certainly shows that no regard is had to our own worth; for it is just as if he had said, Since in the whole seed of Adam our heavenly Father found nothing worthy of his election, he turned his eye upon his own Anointed, that he might select as members of his body those whom he was to assume into the fellowship of life. By saying they were elected before the foundation of the world, he takes away all reference to worth. In the additional statement that they were elected that they might be holy, the apostle openly refutes the error of those who deduce election from prescience, since he declares that whatever virtue appears in men is the result of election. Then, if a higher cause is asked, Paul answers that God so predestined, and predestined according to the good pleasure of his will. If you say that he foresaw they would be holy, and therefore elected them, you invert the order of Paul. You may, therefore, safely infer, If he elected us that we might be holy, he did not elect us because he foresaw that we would be holy. Hence, what Christ said to his disciples is found to be universally applicable to all believers, “Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you,” (John 15:16) In another passage, to suppress the vain boasting of those who, while only covered with a mask, claim for themselves in the view of the world a first place among the godly, Paul says, “The Lord knoweth them that are his,” (2 Tim. 2:19). In short, by that term he designates two classes of people, the one consisting of the whole race of Abraham, the other a people separated from that race, and though hidden from human view, yet open to the eye of God. And there is no doubt that he took the passage from Moses, who declares that God would be merciful to whomsoever he pleased “All that the Father giveth me shall come to me.” “And this is the Father’s will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose nothing,” (John 6:37, 39). Observe that the donation of the Father is the first step in our delivery into the charge and protection of Christ. Some one, perhaps, will here turn round and object, that those only peculiarly belong to the Father who make a voluntary surrender by faith. But the only thing which Christ maintains is that though the defections of vast multitudes should shake the world, yet the counsel of God would stand firm, more stable than heaven itself, that his election would never fail. The elect are said to have belonged to the Father before he bestowed them on his only begotten Son. We must, indeed hold, when he affirms that he knows whom he has chosen, first, that some individuals of the human race are denoted; and, secondly, that they are not distinguished by the quality of their virtues, but by a heavenly decree. Hence it follows, that since Christ makes himself the author of election, none excel by their own strength or industry. For when he says, “Those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost but the son of perdition,” (John 17:12), the expression, though there is a catachresis in it, is not at all ambiguous. The sum is, that God by gratuitous adoption forms those whom he wishes to have for sons; but that the intrinsic cause is in himself, because he is contented with his secret pleasure. Some object that God would be inconsistent with himself, in inviting all without distinction while he elects only a few. Thus, according to them, the universality of the promise destroys the distinction of special grace. […] by external preaching all are called to faith and repentance, and that yet the Spirit of faith and repentance is not given to all […] But it is by Isaiah he more clearly demonstrates how he destines the promises of salvation specially to the elect (Isa. 8:16); for he declares that his disciples would consist of them only, and not indiscriminately of the whole human race. Whence it is evident that the doctrine of salvation, which is said to be set apart for the sons of the Church only, is abused when it is represented as effectually available to all. […] Isaiah assigns the cause when he says that the arm of the Lord is not revealed to all (Isa. 53:1). How, then, can it consistently be said, that God calls while he knows that the called will not come? […] Moreover, if election is, as Paul declares, the parent of faith, I retort the argument, and maintain that faith is not general, since election is special. For it is easily inferred from the series of causes and effects, when Paul says, that the Father “has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world,” (Eph. 1:3, 4), that these riches are not common to all, because God has chosen only whom he would. We come now to the reprobate, to whom the Apostle at the same time refers (Rom. 9:13). For as Jacob, who as yet had merited nothing by good works, is assumed into favor; so Esau, while as yet unpolluted by any crime, is hated. If we turn our view to works, we do injustice to the Apostle, as if he had failed to see the very thing which is clear to us. Moreover, there is complete proof of his not having seen it, since he expressly insists that when as yet they had done neither good nor evil, the one was elected, the other rejected, in order to prove that the foundation of divine predestination is not in works. Then after starting the objection, Is God unjust? instead of employing what would have been the surest and plainest defense of his justice-viz. that God had recompensed Esau according to his wickedness, he is contented with a different solution-viz. that the reprobate are expressly raised up, in order that the glory of God may thereby be displayed. At last, he concludes that God has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth (Rom. 9:18). You see how he refers both to the mere pleasure of God. Therefore, if we cannot assign any reason for his bestowing mercy on his people, but just that it so pleases him, neither can we have any reason for his reprobating others but his will. When God is said to visit in mercy or harden whom he will, men are reminded that they are not to seek for any cause beyond his will.

            <content type="html">
              Haskell vs Clojure syntax Clojure has virtually zero syntax. What I mean by that is that all structures look the same: the first item in a list is the function and the rest are the arguments. This is true for variable assignment, if statements, data structures and functions themselves. (+ 1 2) (defn greet [name] (str &#34;Hello &#34; name)) (def user-count 334) However, before you can do anything useful in Haskell, you must learn all kinds of crazy syntax: function definitions, pattern matching, do forms, functors, monads, typeclasses, … (*) &lt;$&gt; Just 2 &lt;*&gt; Just 8 Nothing &gt;&gt;= \x -&gt; return (x*10) instance Applicative Maybe where pure = Just Nothing &lt;*&gt; _ = Nothing (Just f) &lt;*&gt; something = fmap f something This is why I find Haskell extremely hard to learn. It’s not because of monads, recursion or functional programming concepts. It’s because of the huge amount of special syntax. And you need to learn a lot of it before you can do something useful.

              Canada is a schizophrenic country I have now lived in Canada for over two years and there are some things that Canadians can’t seem to make up their mind on. Spelling Canadian spelling is stuck half way between British spelling and American spelling. Canadians will say: colour, favourite, honour (which are all British) program, realize (which are all American) Measuring units When you’re driving in Canada, everything is in kilometers. Snow fall is measured in centimeters. And yet, people insist on weighing and measuring themselves in pounds. We just had a baby girl here in Canada and they kept saying, Look she is so big, she is probably over eight.. Sure, she was nice and big but she certainly didn’t weight 8kg! People ask me, How tall are you?, and I respond with 178 and receive blank stares.

              10 chapters You get through the less glamorous parts while still being nourished. It’s not a read-your-bible-in-a-year plan. It’s more of a plan for reading the Bible as a way of life. You’re never done. You don’t read the Bible so many times in a year. You read Acts 12 times, all gospels 4 times, etc. You always read different things together. There isn’t as much guilt when skipping a day because you don’t fall behind. 10 chapters a day might be a lot for some people but I find it a nice balance.

            <content type="html">
              Gender inclusive language In a recent sermon at our church, a pastor student said to us that we are no longer able to say that Jesus will make his disciples fishers of men. Rather, she suggested, we should use the politically correct phrase fishers of people. There is always talk of gender-inclusive language when it comes to Bible translation. But this one seems a little too far. Or it doesn’t feel right. As I have been thinking about this, I came across other things we say that that are sexist in this way that don’t seem to bother anyone. Watch any detective show and without fail, the perpetrator or killer will be called he and him. Women never kill. Within the committees of our church, we longer say chairman but chairperson. If we were to follow that same logic, we should refer to snowmen as snowpeople. The other day, my family visited my mother-in-law while she was selling her home &amp; gift products at an event. At one point, she said “… I can’t I’m manning my table.” Was she really? Shouldn’t she have said womanning? A little absurd.

              Mutt sidebar labels The sidebar in Mutt is useful if you have multiple email accounts and want to switch between them quickly. It shows you each inbox with a number of unread emails. I have 6 Gmail accounts plugged into my Mutt and here is what I used to see. INBOX (1) INBOX INBOX (2) INBOX (1) INBOX (7) INBOX And I had to remember which one was which. Let’s say you have your mailboxes in ~/.mail. $ ls ~/.mail work home Create a directory called aliases and symlink the inboxes to that directory: $ ln -s ~/.mail/work/INBOX ~/.mail/alias/work $ ln -s ~/.mail/home/INBOX ~/.mail/alias/home Then, point your Mutt sidebar config at those. When you open Mutt the next time, it should look like this work (1) home (8) That’s much more useful than just a list of INBOX things.

            <content type="html">
              Haskell Strings It continues to amaze me how bad Haskell is at processing strings. One of the reasons I wanted to learn Haskell was to be able to write short, dynamic-language-like programs that execute fast once compiled. Somehow rather, Haskell has failed to deliver on its promise of bare metal speed. I mostly write scripts and utilities meant to run on my machine—these scripts mostly process text. Read a file, parse it and spit something out. Example Let’s build a simple program that will show what I’m talking about. Read a file called file which contains prose Capitalize every word in that body of text Print the result to stdout We will be testing our programs with a file with about 1.2 million lines of Lorem Ipsum. This file is around 75MB. Here is attemp number one. This is really simple Haskell. -- Normal.hs module Main where import Data.Char convert :: String -&gt; String convert = unlines . (map convertLine) . lines convertLine :: String -&gt; String convertLine = unwords . (map convertWord) . words convertWord :: String -&gt; String convertWord s = (toUpper (head s)):(tail s) main = do name &lt;- readFile &#34;file&#34; putStr $ convert name Compile and execute with ghc -O2 -o normal Normal.hs time ./normal &gt; /dev/null This takes about 17 seconds. Let’s see if we can do any better. When you complain about Strings in Haskell being slow on some neckbeard forum, people will tell you to use Data.Text. -- Main.hs module Main where import Data.Char import qualified Data.Text as T import qualified Data.Text.IO as X convert :: T.Text -&gt; T.Text convert = T.unlines . (map convertLine) . T.lines convertLine :: T.Text -&gt; T.Text convertLine = T.unwords . (map convertWord) . T.words convertWord :: T.Text -&gt; T.Text convertWord s = T.cons (toUpper (T.head s)) (T.tail s) main = do name &lt;- X.readFile &#34;file&#34; X.putStr $ convert name This is mostly the same as above. Instead of using the String type to work with text, we use the Data.Text.Text type. ghc -O2 -o main Main.hs time ./main &gt; /dev/null How did it do? One entire minute, that’s 5 times slower. And it uses obscene amounts of memory (around 600MB on my machine). Let’s use lazy IO when reading the file, maybe it will improve. -- change this import qualified Data.Text as T import qualified Data.Text.IO as X -- to this import qualified Data.Text.Lazy as T import qualified Data.Text.Lazy.IO as X This clocks in at 27 seconds. Much better than the non-lazy version. Next thing to try is to ignore unicode and go for the ultimate, bare-metal speed. Let’s use ByteString instead of Text. module Byte where import Data.Char import qualified Data.ByteString as B import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as C convert :: B.ByteString -&gt; B.ByteString convert = C.unlines . (map convertLine) . C.lines convertLine :: B.ByteString -&gt; B.ByteString convertLine = C.unwords . (map convertWord) . C.words convertWord :: B.ByteString -&gt; B.ByteString convertWord s = C.cons (toUpper (C.head s)) (C.tail s) main = do name &lt;- B.readFile &#34;file&#34; B.putStr $ convert name Hm, not that much better. 27 seconds. That’s about as good as the lazy version when using Text. Let’s see if we can squeeze more perfomance out of this with a lazy ByteString -- change this import qualified Data.ByteString as B import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as C -- to this import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy as B import qualified Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8 as C This takes about 10 seconds. Awesome. This is the best I can do with Haskell. 10 seconds to process 1.2 million lines of text. I guess that’s not too bad. EDIT: Someone pointed out on Reddit that this whole thing can be accomplished as a simple one-liner. This is actually a pretty elegant solution. module Main where import Data.Char import qualified Data.Text.Lazy as T import qualified Data.Text.Lazy.IO as X convert :: T.Text -&gt; T.Text convert = T.tail . T.scanl (\a b -&gt; if isSpace a then toUpper b else b) &#39; &#39; main = do name &lt;- X.readFile &#34;file&#34; X.putStr $ convert name This clocks in at 8.5 seconds. Not bad at all. EDIT 5: Someone pointed out that I didn’t include a version of the one-liner that uses ByteString. module Main where import Data.Char import qualified Data.ByteString.Char8 as T convert :: T.ByteString -&gt; T.ByteString convert = T.tail . T.scanl (\a b -&gt; if isSpace a then toUpper b else b) &#39; &#39; main = do name &lt;- T.readFile &#34;file&#34; T.putStr $ convert name This clocks in at 3.5s on my machine. Pretty fast! Python Let’s try this in Python def process(data): lines = data.split(&#39;\n&#39;) return &#34;\n&#34;.join([process_line(line) for line in lines]) def process_line(line): words = line.split(&#39; &#39;) new = [w.capitalize() for w in words] return &#34; &#34;.join(new) if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = open(&#39;file&#39;).read() print process(data) Execute with $ time python main.py &gt; /dev/null Six seconds! Six! How can a dynamic language be so much faster than compiled Haskell? EDIT 4: There has been some discussion on Reddit about being able to accomplish this task in only one line in Haskell. It’s actually possible in Python, too. print open(&#39;file&#39;).read().title() This clocks in at 2 seconds. Javascript and V8 // main.js var fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;); function capitalize(string) { return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1); } function processLine(line) { var words = line.split(&#39; &#39;); for (var i=0; i &lt; words.length; i++) { words[i] = capitalize(words[i]); } return words.join(&#39; &#39;); } function run() { var data = fs.readFileSync(&#39;file&#39;, &#39;utf-8&#39;); var lines = data.split(&#39;\n&#39;); for (var i=0; i &lt; lines.length; i++) { lines[i] = processLine(lines[i]); } return lines.join(&#34;\n&#34;); } console.log(run()); Execute it with: $ time node main.js &gt; /dev/null Wait for it! 4.5 seconds. I have no words. How about Go? EDIT 3: (Add this section. Looks like this post is turning into a language shootout, le sigh). package main import ( &#34;fmt&#34; &#34;io/ioutil&#34; &#34;bytes&#34; ) func main() { body, _ := ioutil.ReadFile(&#34;file&#34;) result := bytes.Title(body) fmt.Printf(&#34;%s&#34;, result) } Put this into title.go, compile and run with $ go build title.go $ time ./title &gt; /dev/null This is around 2 seconds. Pretty crazy performance. Only twice the time compared to C. How about C? EDIT 2: (Add this section) Andrew Stewart has graciously written a C version of this program. Like he said, you should do all of your scripting in C. // script.c #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;string.h&gt; int main(void) { static const char filename[] = &#34;file&#34;; FILE *file = fopen(filename, &#34;r&#34;); if (file != NULL) { char line[1024]; while(fgets(line, sizeof line, file) != NULL) { line[strcspn (line, &#34;\n&#34;)] = &#39;\0&#39;; int lengthOfLine = strlen(line); int word = 0; int i; for (i = 0; i &lt; lengthOfLine; i++) { if (isalpha(line[i])) { if (!word) { line[i] = (char) toupper (line[i]); word = 1; } } else { word = 0; } } printf (&#34;%s\n&#34;, line); } fclose(file); } else { perror(filename); } return 0; } Compile and run this with: $ gcc -o script script.c $ time ./script &gt; /dev/null Of course, this is ripping fast. It takes about 1 second (1.05-1.15, never below 1). Recap Haskell - String 17s Haskell - Text 60s Haskell - Text (Lazy) 27s Haskell - ByteString 27s Haskell - ByteString (Lazy) 10s Haskell - Text, scanl (Lazy) 8.5s Haskell - ByteString, scanl 3.5s Python - 6s Python - One line, titl() 2s Javascript &amp; V8 4.5s Go 2s C 1s Not sure if I want to continue learning Haskell after this.

            <content type="html">
              On Learning Clojure Prefix notation I’m a big fan of the prefix notation. It makes everything appear the same (if-statements, function calls , etc). I like how it removes the need for operator precedence rules. All the parentheses Once you get into learning Clojure and you have written a small application, you don’t really see the parens anymore. Sure, sometimes you still get the Unbalanced parens error but those are easy to spot. If you are afraid of learning a LISP because of this, don’t worry, you’ll be fine. JVM Let’s just say that the start-up time of the JVM isn’t the fastest. This makes Clojure effectively useless for writing utility scripts. However, the JVM is a robust platform that runs your code really fast. With Clojure, you get all the benefits of the JVM: garbage collection, JIT, uberjars, etc. Using Java libraries in Clojure is usually pretty straightforward if you know the basics of Java (but the code isn’t the prettiest). This is great because some of the lower level stuff doesn’t have to be reimplemented (think SHA1 digests, sockets, etc). Documentation The language itself seems to be documented pretty well. I haven’t had any issues when trying to find the signature for a built-in function. However, the community isn’t exactly known for writing documentation. Most of the time, you find a library on Github and you are left to read the source. If you are lucky, you are told what to import and a few basic examples. Good documentation is something I take for granted coming from the Python world. Libraries While you can certainly find a lot of good libraries for doing common things, one area is still painful to develop for: the web. Clojure still needs a Django-like web framework that has all the batteries included. Right now, the only popular web framework is Noir and it’s more like Sinatra or Flask. Without a Django-like platform, you end up reinventing all the common things for every application: authentication, form validation, ORM, etc. Conclusion I really like the language. I like the functional aspects of it and the immutability. I like lazy sequences and refs. What I don’t like is that the community and the ecosystem is still a bit young and immature. I find myself waiting for stuff to happen before I can use this language more.

              Large Javascript Application Tips This post isn’t going to tell you that you should use MVC to structure your application. It isn’t going to tell you which framework to use. It’s not going to tell you to use CoffeeScript or MongoDB. But I’m going to talk about some small helpful things you can do to your Javascript application to make easier to develop and maintain. Naming Conventions Improperly naming your variables, functions and classes can make it nearly impossible to navigate large portions of existing code. You have to follow the chain all the way up where that variable was created (sometimes in a different file) to see what type of value it holds. By looking at a variable name, you should be able to tell if it’s a class definition or an instance. You should be able to distinguish between a constant and a function. File dependency Writing large Javascript applications for the browser is tricky because your application needs to be split over multiple files and there doesn’t seem to be a good way to manage dependencies. When you open up a file in your project, you can’t really know what Javascript code was loaded and executed before this file. Often times you find yourself looking at your build script or the head of your HTML document to see when this file is loaded in the grand scheme of things. In Python, you say from app import get_user to use a function from a different file or module. In the browser, you just don’t. I find it useful to specify these kinds of dependencies at the top of each file within a simple comment. // maps.js // // This file provides the ``Maps`` namespace. // It depends on jQuery and jquery.cookie.js. // It depends on the ``userId`` variable from the document. // // (function($) { // ... Class definition time and consumption time There should be a clear distinction between when your classes are defined and when they are consumed. I like to prepare all my classes and functions beforehand, and then kick off the app with a single call when the document is ready. It’s nice to be able to tell that this is where the app starts. Namespaces Your entire application should be contained within a namespace. Putting all of your code under a namespace makes it easy to tell where what function or class definition is coming from. It makes sure that you don’t pollute the global namespace. It also allows you to select which functions and variables are going to be exposed publicly. Documentation If your application isn’t going to be open-source, you might be tempted to skip writing documentation. Adding a few comments here and there in the code can help you quickly understand what is going on and where related code might live. This also helps a lot when on-boarding new developers. When a new member of your team opens up an 800-line-of-code file with zero comments, they might crawl under their desk and cry (I’ve wanted to do that a few times before). Frameworks If you do decide to use a framework like Backbone.js, you should make sure that you use it in a sane way. When a new member joins your team, it’s really nice when you can point them to the framework’s documentation and have them start learning. Obviously, you will want to do some custom things and maybe even build extensions to the framework and that’s fine as long as it’s documented and obvious. Conclusion Thanks for listening

            <content type="html">
              Why you should use Heroku for your next start-up You are a ninja-rockstar developer with a billion dollar idea. You write Ruby and Javascript. You like BDD, responsive design, HTML5 and node.js. You are really good at UX and quickly producing a prototype. You have been working on your app for a few months. Now it’s time to deploy your app. Because you are a hot new start-up, you will of course use AWS. You spend a few hours trying to figure out how many of which instance type you will need. You decide you need a load balancer, a bunch of app servers, a database server and a worker server. That should about cover you. Next up is Chef. You spend a few days learning about provisioning a new VM with Chef. You are so excited about how you can automatically provision a new app server when your start-up hits the front page of TechCrunch. You spend a week configuring and testing your Chef scripts. And then the big day comes. You deploy your application. Everything works the first time and you are overjoyed. First users start to appear and your architecture performs really well. You hit the front page of HackerNews and get tens of thousands of hits on your site. You find a small bug in your cache invalidation logic which you fix really quickly. You deploy your fix and what do you know? That script that installs your project’s dependencies when you deploy just pulled in a new version of a library that deploys your static files to S3. And of course that new version contains backwards incompatible changes and completely breaks your app. You are frantically trying to figure out what happened. You think, OK, I will put up a maintenance page while I sort this out. You try to SSH into your load balancer and try to change the routing settings. What a mess. What do you do when your database starts swapping? What happens when your Redis server runs out of memory and dies? You barely understand how to install MySQL, let alone how to get the most out of it. Enter Heroku. Single command deployments. Fully-managed database service. Automatic load-balancing. On-demand scaling. No manual SSH to see what’s wrong. A request comes in, the load balancer picks it up and sends it to a suitable app server instance. The app server instance talks to a highly optimized database instance. Redis is sitting on a super beefy machine with lots of RAM and you never have to worry about it. When you are ready to make a deployment, the load balancer bounces each app server in turn to make sure you don’t lose any requests. All you need to do is git push heroku master. Sure, Heroku is a bit more expensive than EC2. But when you think of how many smart people are taking care of your app, it’s really cheap. It’s like having your own sys admin. You need it. Disclaimer: I’m in no way connected to Heroku. This posts is an attempt to convince myself that I shouldn’t be using Chef for my side-project-start-up-ideas. And I’m not a Ruby guy.

            <content type="html">
              How I use git Recently, I have noticed that there are quite a few wrappers around git to give you a nicer interface to work with. The new commands promise to be easy to remember and make your life less frustrating. I find these a little silly because git on its own is a great tool. Here I’m going to describe how I use git to convince you (and myself) that it’s not that hard. Cloning This couldn’t be any simpler: git clone git://github.com/honza/dotfiles.git Committing Once I have cloned a repo, I start to make changes. To see what files I have changed, I run git status Or to see what actual changes I made git diff Then, when I’m ready to commit, I stage the files. The index is one of my favorite features of git. It lets me decide what changes I want to commit. Maybe I correct something as I work on something else. Those things aren’t related so they shouldn’t go into the same commit. I grew up on Mercurial and not having the index in Mercurial now really bothers me. To stage all changed files, I do git add -u If I decide that the changes I made are stupid and I want to get rid of them, I do git checkout . To make sure all staged changes are the right ones git diff --cached Stashing I often stash my code. Sometimes you need to look at some code in a different branch, sometimes I notice something is broken and I want to see if I broke it or not. git stash will stash your changes. To get it back I do git stash pop And also, often I will see what I had stashed git stash list Branches Creating new branches is simple and cheap git checkout -b new_branch Delete a branch git branch -d branch_name Or delete a branch on a remote server git push origin :branch_name Rebasing I have written on rebasing before. It makes your history much nicer. Any time I pull code from a remote repository, I do git pull --rebase Or, if it’s a specific branch git pull --rebase origin dev Bisecting I love the bisect commnad in git. You can use it to determine which commit introduced a bug. This is especially useful if you have a comprehensive test suite. For example, the latest commit is broken and you remember that all tests where passing in version 1.2. This example uses Django. git bisect start HEAD v1.2 -- # HEAD is bad, v1.2 is good git bisect run python manage.py test Git will then keep running your tests until it finds the first commit that’s broken. Merging When a feature branch is finished, I merge it into master with git checkout master git merge --no-ff feature Viewing history For viewing history, I really like the following command git log --pretty=format:&#34;%h - %an, %ar : %s&#34;&#39; This gives you the commit SHA, then the author’s name, how long ago it was made and a brief, one-line summary of the changes. I have it aliased as gitl. I also use a simple graph to see the relationships between branches git log --oneline --graph Upgrading all submodules in a project This one is great, too. I use it to upgrade all of my vim plugins. git submodule foreach git pull Pulling and pushing This is pretty straight forward git pull git pull origin dev git push git push origin dev Conclusion Once you learn what git calls what, it’s pretty easy to just google the thing you’re trying to do. I’m definitely not an expert but this gets me by.

            <content type="html">
              Standing desk - first impressions I have recently switched jobs and had to set up a home office. I have heard a lot of good things about standing desks and thought this was the perfect opportunity to try one. I had looked for one online but those things aren’t cheap (~ $800). Instead of dropping some serious cash, I stacked up some bins and made a poorman’s standing desk. I have a laptop stand and a second monitor. Nothing special, really. I have been standing while programming for over a week now and I wanted to share a few thoughts. If you’re wondering if you should get a standing desk, I’d definitely recommend it. Incentives I have set up my desk in such a way that if I want to sit down to do some work I have to give up the second monitor and my Das keyboard. I use a 13” Macbook Pro so the number of pixels is rather limited. I love my loud Das keyboard and want to use it as much as possible. This works extremely well. Breaks When I take a break to have lunch with my family (or something like that), I make it a point to sit down and rest my feet. When I get back in the office, I don’t feel like I’m gonna die. Distractions I have found that when I’m standing I rarely check Hacker News or read articles. I think it’s because reading an article or two isn’t complex enough for my brain and it can do other things at the same time—like think about how much my feet hurt. I find that when I’m standing I get a lot more done because I can focus a lot more. Near the end of the day when I’m tired and actually do sit down to work, I feel like I’m walking under water. Since I’m just getting started I have allowed myself some slack here and there. I don’t want to go too fast and burn out. Dancing I have heard that people like to dance when they’re standing at their desk. I always thought this was pretty silly until I caught myself doing it. I listen to a lot of rock n roll so it’s not exactly surprising. Pain Obviously, your feet will hurt. However, it’s not nearly as bad as I thought. I’m 23 and fairly fit so maybe that’s a factor. I have had some minor lower back pain which I think is caused by the fact that I now have good posture and the body isn’t used to it. Conclusion Do you stand while working? Ever thought about getting a standing desk?

            <content type="html">
              How Rackspace deleted my server I have been with Rackspace for a while now and never had problems. The server has been fast and responsive and their prices are great. However, what happened yesterday blew my mind and totally made me change how I view server providers as a whole—including the likes of AWS and Heroku. Here is how it went down. 2:07pm CST I got an email from one of my administrators that the front end was unreachable. I immediately tried to visit the web application in my browser, log into the machine via SSH and ping the server IP address. All failed. I went on the Rackspace Cloud Server Live Chat to raise the issue with them. 2:48pm CST I was told to open a ticket through the admin console. So I did and I handed the ticket number to the operator who said they’d pass it on to operations. 5:05pm CST I got a reply on the ticket. All it says is we’re working on it. At this point, I’m freaking out because I have been down for over three hours. 6:00pm CST Still no word from Rackspace. I got on the phone and explained the issue and that I didn’t feel it was being taken seriously. The operator got the account manager on the phone who in turn got a tech guy on the call. They said that the VM wasn’t built properly when I first created it like 6 months ago and that at that time it was queued up to be deleted and rebuilt. It took this long to finally come down the queue and actually get deleted. They said they would rebuild the server and let me keep the same IP and that I would get an email with new credentials. 6:17pm CST I received said email and started to restore the server. Luckily, I had a working Chef script which made this very simple to do. I think I was back online in about 30 minutes. Conclusion Everyone has been really nice and apologetic. They even gave me a month’s credit to cover the damages. I still think Rackspace is great but this whole incident made me realize that anything can fail and that you should design your application for easy recovery. And test your backups!

            <content type="html">
              Remap CapsLock to something useful Arguably, CapsLock is the most useless key on your keyboard. I honestly can’t remember the last time I had a real use for it. If are a programmer, you should remap it to something more useful. The rest of this post will describe how to remap your CapsLock on a Mac OSX installation. What we are going to do I’m a heavy vim user and reaching for the Esc key all the is a pain. We will remap the CapsLock to Esc. However, I want to be able to use it for something else if I’m not in vim. We will set it up so that when you hit CapsLock on its own, it will send Esc. However, if you hold CapsLock and press another key, it will send Ctrl. That way you can do things like Ctrl+F, etc. On Mac OSX, you will want to do use Karabiner. It’s an excellent piece of software that will allow you to take control of your keyboard. Settings Once you have installed KeyRemap4MacBook, go to System Preferences and select the Keyboard submenu. Hit the Modifier Keys button and remap CapsLock to Ctrl. You will have to do this once for every keyboard that you use. Next, head over to the KeyRemap4MacBook settings. The magical setting you are looking for is Control_L to Control_L (+ When you type Control_L only, send Escape) That’s it!

            <content type="html">
              How not to depend on PyPI When deploying a Django application, you often use a requirements.txt file that contains a list of the application’s dependencies. During deployment, your provisioning system will pip install all of those to make sure that your application runs as desired. The format of a typical requirements.txt files isn’t unlike the following django==1.3.1 psycopg2==2.4.4 Fabric==1.3.3 ... By default, pip will go to the Python Package Index (PyPI) and look for that package there. Unfortunately, PyPI has been known to be down or slow at times; and you want your deployments to be as smooth as possible. What you can do Instead of depending on PyPI for a production application, you can host the packages that your application needs yourself. It’s actually surpringly easy to do. Your existing deployment strategy can easily be modified to remove the dependency. First, we will create a freeze of your requirements. This will look into your environment and figure out which version of which package you will need for the production environment. $ pip freeze -r requirements.txt &gt; freeze.txt Once you have the list of packages, you can tell pip to download all the packages into a directory without installing them. $ pip install -d pypi -r freeze.txt This will download all packages from freeze.txt into the pypi/ directory. The next step is to upload all these packages to a publicly accessible server that can serve static files. This can anything from S3, Cloudfiles or even Github pages. I like to place all of these packages into a packages/ directory. You will also need a simple index file to go with your packages. All the index file needs to is provide a list of HTML links to those packages. The index will be used by pip to locate the package source distribution. I have put together a simple Fabric task that will read the contents of the pypi/ directory and create this index file for you. def make_index(): result = local(&#39;ls pypi&#39;, capture=True) packages = result.split(&#39;\n&#39;) html = &#34;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;%s&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&#34; links = [] for package in packages: link = &#39;&lt;a href=&#34;packages/%s&#34;&gt;%s&lt;/a&gt;&#39; % (package, package) links.append(link) links = &#39;\n&#39;.join(links) f = open(&#39;index.html&#39;, &#39;w&#39;) f.write(html % links) f.close() Upload the index file to your server and you’re ready to deploy. Instead of the usual: $ pip install -r requirements.txt You will run this: $ pip install -r freeze.txt -f http://yourPypiHost.com/index.html --no-index This will completely ignore PyPI and only use your index when locating packages. This way your deploys will be faster and more reliable.

            <content type="html">
              Disrupt the multiple-gmail space We all know that Gmail is the best email provider out there. It’s in the browser, it’s all ajaxy, you never delete anything, your emails are cleverly organized into conversations, you know the drill… But have you ever tried to use more than one account at a time? It’s horribly broken. Let’s have a look at your options… Multiple sign-in Google allows you to log into more than one account at a time. They provide you with a menu option to switch between the two and you are all set. The problem is that the constant switching back and forth just isn’t worth it. Use a desktop client If you use a desktop client like Thunderbird or Mail.app, you can have as many accounts as you want. But you don’t get access to your contacts and rarely get the nice conversation view for your messages. In addition, the applications are often bloated and use a ton of memory. Use mutt or pino These light-weight applications are popular especially among programmers. They are a pain to setup and lack email address autocompletion. Use multiple browsers If you have one or two Gmail accounts, you could probably get away with using two browsers - one for each account. This is silly and you shouldn’t do that. Use Chrome profiles Newer versions of Chome will allow you to be logged into different Gmail accounts in different windows. This means that each window is logged into a single Google account and can only access the services associated with that account. This is fine for two accounts, but if you have 4+ it can get ridiculous pretty fast. None of these options give you a good solution for a unified inbox. They all have their shortcomings. There is a huge opportunity to disrupt this space as they are a lot of us who have to use a lot of different Gmail accounts. I have been using Mozilla Thunderbird with two add-ons: Google contacts and Google Conversations. They are rather close to doing the right thing but it’s still missing something. I tried to set up mutt but it wasn’t working for me because of the missing autocomplete. Your say What do you use? How do you deal with this mess?

            <title>Upgrading your Django media files to use a CDN</title>

            <id>https://honza.ca/2012/01/upgrading-your-django-media-files-to-use-a-cdn</id>

            <content type="html">
              Upgrading your Django media files to use a CDN I was using django-filebrowser on a project and my Rackspace VM quickly ran out of disk space. Since the site isn’t getting much traffic at all, I didn’t want to pay extra for a bigger VM. Instead, I decided to move all of the user uploaded media to Rackspace Cloudfiles. It’s super cheap and they have a nice API. Now, the challenge was to make the transition from a filebrowser-based system. First of all, I knew I was going to use django-storages as the new storage class for my class. I played around with it on the side and it worked like a charm. Next, I wrote a quick little Python script to upload all of the files to Cloudfiles. Since the filenames didn’t change at all, I could just write a South migration that would strip the /uploads part and be done with it. I had a look at the Django documentation to see what exactly a FileField was. It turns out it takes a Django File object which in turn is a thin wrapper around the Python built-in file object. This didn’t sound exactly easy to do. I would have to open a remote file with Python’s open(‘file.mp3’) and have Django inspect it for size and file type. This is clunky at best if you remember that this will have to live in a South migration. Also worth noting is the fact that filebrowser’s model field is a subclass of CharField and has no special file-related properties or methods. You can’t use the DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS setting because filebrowser will start yelling at you. Instead, you specify the storage class right in the new model field. from storages.backends.mosso import cloudfiles_upload_to, CloudFilesStorage cloudfiles_storage = CloudFilesStorage() class Item(models.Model): old_field = FileBrowseField(max_length=500, blank=True) new_field = models.FileField(upload_to=cloudfiles_upload_to, storage=cloudfiles_storage, default=&#39;&#39;) Now you can go and write your migration and Django won’t yell at you. Now we go back to the problem outlined above. How do you create an instance of File to pass to item.new_field. After hours of reading the source and debugging, I realized that you can simply pass in the filename as a string and the storage class will do the right thing. It’s actually really simple and painless. Your data migration might look something like: for item in orm.Item.objects.all(): item.new_field = os.path.basename(item.old_field.url) item.save() So, I was already somewhat overjoyed that this would in fact be easy and then I discovered that the change from filebrowser to django-storages doesn’t require a schema migration. This means that if your file names are the same there is no database change needed at all. How cool is that?

              Inerrancy As evangelical Christians, we believe in what is called the inerrancy of the Bible. This means that we believe that the Word of God contains no mistakes. I love the way pastor Mark Driscoll puts it: If we see something in the Bible that we don’t agree with, it means we’re wrong. I am continually amazed at how many people will dismiss entire passages in the Bible as silly or primitive. We are intelligent modern people, we don’t believe in fairy tales. We have democracy now. We believe in equality. Let me remind you that the Bible is the book that God wrote. Is God different today and yesterday? Augustine: If you believe what you like in the gospel, and reject what you don’t like, it is not the gospel you believe, but yourself. D. A. Carson: Those who don’t have a high view of Scripture, do not feel bound to obey it.

            <content type="html">
              Writing Node.js modules To say that node.js has enjoyed a great deal of positive publicity in the last few months would most certainly be an understatement. New node.js-related projects are popping up all over the place, and there seems to be this notion that if you aren’t using it you’re not cool enough. Over the Christmas holidays, I sat down to sort out my photo library and I wanted to make a web photo gallery to share the images with family and friends. Being a mainly Python programmer, I wrote a Python script that will go through all of my photos and create smaller versions and thumbnails of the images that are suitable for the web. I think I have around 1500 images at the moment and it took a good 20 minutes to convert everything using Python Imaging Library. I was rather frustrated with the performance. I think the reason for the slowness was the fact that the images were processed sequentially, one by one. What if I could modify my program to process more than one image at a time. This would certainly speed by the process. Then I thought about using threads in Python and I think I threw up in my mouth a little. Then I remembered Node.js. It’s supposed to be all asynchronous and non-blocking. Perfect match. So I wrote a thumbnailer in node. Essentially, it’s a worker queue that resizes images. You give it a source and destination directories and a number of workers and run it. The total time went from 20 minutes to 2 using about 5 workers. Much better, eh? I decided to open source the project because I couldn’t find any node.js projects that do something even remotely similar. It’s called node-thumbnail and you can find it on both Github and npmjs. So what does the API look like? thumb({ source: &#39;source/path&#39;, destination: &#39;dest/path&#39;, concurrency: 4 }, function() { console.log(&#39;All done!&#39;); });

            <content type="html">
              Interpretation mistakes Many people today who claim to be and likely are sincere followers of Jesus Christ aren’t properly educated in the discipline of biblical exegesis and interpretation. Of course not everyone can or wants to go to seminary to study this topic. We can’t fault people to be ignorant about rather complex matters. However, an introduction to the art of interpretation wouldn’t hurt anyone. My reasoning behind this assertion is that the lack of basic understanding of exegesis causes unnecessary conflict within the church. In the rest of this articles, I would like to show an example of this. Please bear in mind that the arguments presented here aren’t meant to convince anyone of any particular position, but rather, to show how difficult these arguments can be. Let’s dive right in. Many people in the church today argue over the issue of women’s position within the Christian society. Some argue that they are equal to men in all regards and some argue that God created men and women in his image but for different purposes. This becomes an issue in two particular passages: Ephesians 5 where we learn of how the husband and the wife are to conduct themselves in the marriage; and 1 Timothy 2 where Paul forbids women from entering into the office of an elder. Let’s look at the Ephesians passage first. When women read that passage, the first thing they think is that they are by no means going submit to their husbands because they live in a society that doesn’t discriminated based on gender. They dismiss the biblical account based on how they see themselves in the 21st century society. The Pauline theology is deemed out-dated and irrelevant to the modern person. If instead they read on and paid attention to what the husband’s responsibilities are, they might learn that much greater burden is placed upon him. The husband is to love his wife with the same love that Christ loves the church! The same love with which the Father loves the Son. The sacrificial love that allowed Jesus to suffer and die for undeserving sinners. And that’s no small task! The passage from Timothy is dismissed on similar grounds. A women is as able as a man and shouldn’t be told to refrain from entering into office based on her being a woman. However, this passage says nothing of competency or intelligence. The passage in question in question reads as follows: I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. 1 Timothy 2:12-14 In this case, it’s a question of language that is being ignored. What is Paul’s reason for forbidding the woman from teaching? The order of creation. When God was finished creating the world, he announced that it was very good. This was before the sin entered into the world. Paul grounds his argument in the work of God. He follows God’s hand in history and is consistent with it. This means that we cannot dismiss this instruction as having come from a particular city where women were causing problems and meaning that it doesn’t apply to us. The biggest problem in today’s layperson interpretation is that they project their own ideas onto the biblical text and refuse to accept those verses and ideas that don’t align with they own. This is a very flawed approach. Rather, we should approach the Bible with an attitude of awe, expecting the God of the universe to speak to use in his infinite wisdom. Sadly, a great many people today choose to ignore their God and pursue their own egos and agendas.

When you stare at an LCD screen all day long, the blink interval gets larger. As a result, your eyes become dry and sore. This is further worsened by coffee. Drinking lots of water and using over-the-counter drops will help. This is what my eye doctor told me yesterday.

            <content type="html">
              Data-driven javascript applications Over the last few weeks, I have been trying to think of a way to design medium to large client-heavy web applications. There are many projects and ideas floating around that are meant to help you with this and I have had a look at quite a few of them. I don’t mean to say that I found the best one — just one that I like. I want to talk about data-driven applications. What I mean is that everything you do somehow manipulates or shows specific data. Let me describe what I mean by a way of example. I have been working on a piece of photo gallery software called rembrant. The interface for actually organizing your images into albums is very client-heavy. The user interface is similar to that of iPhoto. The larger panel displays a grid of small thumbnails. The sidebar shows a list of albums and a count of selected images. When the application loads, it makes two calls to the server: one to get a list of all images (image models, including metadata), and a second to get album information. Everything else in the UI is based on these two lists. The list of albums and the image grid are pretty self-explanatory. Once the browser has this data, we can start building out the views. A view is a little windows, or a perspective upon a piece of data. It’s meant to display the data in a meaningful way to the user. For example, in our application, there is a list of albums in the sidebar. These are represented as list items with anchor tags: var SidebarView = Backbone.View.extends({ el: $(&#39;#sidebar&#39;), events: { &#39;click #new-album-link&#39;: &#39;newAlbum&#39; }, initialize: function() { this.collection.bind(&#39;reset&#39;, this.render, this); this.collection.bind(&#39;add&#39;, this.add, this); }, add: function(album) { var albumView = new SidebarAlbumView({ model: album }); this.el.append(albumView.el); }, render: function() { for (var i=0; i &lt; this.collection.models.length; i++) { this.add(this.collection.models[i]); } } }); Here you can see we are binding the view to an existing DOM element with an ID of sidebar. The @collection variable is the collection of albums we spoke about earlier. The view subscribes to the collection’s reset and add events. When a new album is added to the collection, the view will automatically update itself. Also, the events hash allows us to bind event handlers to DOM elements in the sidebar. You may have noticed that I’m using Backbone to actually structure the application. I find that Backbone provides a good compromise between structure and freedom to do as you please. To be honest, it took me a good while to wrap my head around what Backbone is trying to do for you. It may seem a little wordy at times but you shouldn’t expect your application to consist of little code. Now, suppose we wanted to add a count to each album list item which would indicate how many photos are currently in that album. This is easily done by inspecting the photos collection. Backbone provides a simple way to filter your collection based on predefined criteria. To get all photos that belong to the album with an ID of 1, we would do: var PhotoCollection = Backbone.Collection.extends({ model: Photo, url: &#39;/photos&#39;, byAlbum: function(id) { this.filter(function(photo) { return _.indexOf(photo.get(&#39;albums&#39;), id) &gt;= 0; }); } }); // collection is an instance of PhotoCollection photos = collection.byAlbum(1); As you can see, this is very simple and elegant. Now, if a photo is deleted, it will be removed from the collection. This will be reflected both in the grid and in the sidebar. It will all work automatically because all of the views are looking at the same date. They are subscribed to the data’s events and react accordingly. The nice thing is that you don’t have to worry about changing classes, binding data to DOM elements, attaching click handlers, making AJAX requests, none of this. The difficult part about this approach is deciding what your elementary data is and how you should get it. In the case of rembrant it was pretty simple.

            <content type="html">
              On why we lack mature Christians The leadership in the local church is often made up of very incompetent people. I don’t mean incompetent in the sense that they can’t lead. I mean in their knowledge and understanding of theology in general and of the gospel in particular. The Bible says that the leaders in the church should be first and foremost able to teach. If you can’t teach the Bible, perform mature exegesis on a text or even struggle to find a book in the Bible, you shouldn’t lead. Yet, this happens all the time. I have a theory on how this happens. The local church often runs programs that are designed to attract seekers. People come and are lead to Christ. They pray the sinner’s prayer and are introduced to church life. The original group of evangelists moves on to reach new people and the new believer is left mostly alone in the sea of church goers. There is rarely any follow-up. These people are left to themselves. New believers tend to be very excited about their new-found faith and they read their Bibles whenever they get a chance. Time goes on and these new believers learn to walk the walk and talk the talk in the church. They learn some key concepts about how church life works. They learn stories from the gospels, they memorize a few verses from Paul’s epistles and they feel good about themselves. They listen to sermons, they go to prayer meetings and help out where they can. On the outside, it seems that they have it all figured out and their walk with Christ has been fruitful. Once they have been in the church for some 30 years, they naturally gravitate towards leadership roles. They are nominated to serve on the deacon’s board or on the finance committee. Their sense of self-worth rises. They begin to think that since they made it to their new leadership role, they must be a really good Christian. After all, they have been in the church for over 30 years. They have been coming every Sunday, participated in programs and lots more. However, they haven’t been under good Bible teaching. They haven’t read their Bibles in years because they’ve got it all figured out. They know all the stories and parables. They know the hymns and worship songs. But they don’t know basic Christian doctrine. They wouldn’t be able to explain to you the doctrine of sanctification, justification or redemption. They lack understanding of the divine economy. Moreover, they haven’t walked with Christ and therefore lack the practical knowledge of his grace. They don’t pray on a daily basis to align their hearts with the will of God. They are proud and feel a strong sense of entitlement and deservedness. They don’t reflect on the depths of God and his royal magnificence. They are obsessed with legalism and rule-keeping. They think that if they were able to make this far, anyone can. They value tradition. Why change things if they have worked for so many years? They aren’t willing to learn because they know it all. They won’t come to basic Christianity classes because it would be boring for them. The saddest thing about this reality is that we allow these unlearned people to make decisions that impact the life of the wider congregation. What about those who grow up in the church? They have even tougher times getting to the truth because of the older generation that is in power. If you don’t read the Bible for yourself, why would you read it for to your children? If you don’t understand a particular text in the Scriptures, how could your wife?

              Steve Jobs and Richard Stallman Today, news broke about Richard Stallman’s comment on Steve Job’s death. The news of the giant’s passing has stirred up a wave of emotions ranging from utter sadness to feelings of empowerment to do great things. Tributes were paid to Steve Jobs all over the internet. His life is described as one of a genius. Technology celebrities have publicly commented on his death. Richard Stallman said the following: I’m not glad he’s dead, but I’m glad he’s gone. While this could have been said better, I’m absolutely shocked by the harsh comments the community has made towards Dr Stallman. I’m not trying to defend him. He is a caricature like no other. The man possesses no social skills. But he is a respected computer engineer that has changed the way software works today. He has a number of doctorates. Like Steve Jobs, Dr Stallman is a programming genius. His work on the GCC compiler is substantial. Articles like the on ReadWriteWeb are very disappointing. Let’s all be civil and respectful of each other.

            <content type="html">
              On heaven and boredom One of the complaints many atheists raise against becoming a Christian is the fact that heaven will be boring. They have in their minds this idea of us in heaven as chubby toddlers in diapers playing harps and flying around. To me that would be hell. I would like to talk to you about why I think that heaven won’t be boring. Let me start by telling you a how my high school teacher explained to us the concept of geometric parallels. She said they were two lines that didn’t intersect or touch. She also made a side note that the two parallels will intersect at one specific point, being infinity. It takes the two parallel lines all of infinity to reach each other. Now, keep that in mind while we look at some Scripture. Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. – Revelation 21:3, ESV The Bible says that God will live with us, among us, so we can know Him fully. God is omnipotent, omniscient and infinite. To comprehend all of the depths of God, all his wisdom, love and grace, we will need a long time. How long? Well, it’s easy. Exactly one eternity.

            <content type="html">
              Bible translations and the Christian life There are many English translations of the Bible. They were all made for different audiences. They employ different translation techniques. Each Christian celebrity endorses a different translation. The truth of the matter is that a certain Bible translation can be elevated to such a degree that the common believer is made to believe that the translation contains actual words of God. You need to realize that a translation is just that: a translation. No matter how many scholars with the best schools you commission to create this new, true translation of the Scriptures, it is bound to be imperfect in some way. One language cannot accurately convey the same meaning as an another. Each language carries with it a certain culture, sense of humor and ways of expressing common idioms. This is perhaps a little hard to understand if you only speak one language. If you have had to learn English and you moved to foreign country, this idea may be clearer to you. So, where do you go from here? As you may know, the Bible was written in three languages: Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. As Christians, we focus most of our attention on the New Testament which is written in Greek. I am going to suggest that if you are even remotely interested in serious study of the Word of God that you invest a few years of your life and learn New Testament Greek. Now you are thinking that I’m completely crazy. Bear with me for a moment. The vocabulary of the New Testament is final. You don’t need to learn words like airplane, computer or email. If you learn only 300 Greek words, you will understand over 80% of the New Testament; double the amount and you will get up to 90%. I’m confident that after a year of casual study of Greek you can begin to read some of the simpler passages (like 1 John). After another year, you will read Paul’s writing without much hindrance. After 3-4 years, you will be ready to abandon reading the New Testament in English altogether. Let that sink in. There are plenty of good resource for learning New Testament Greek. Both online and in print. One last thing: if you are in your twenties or event thirties and you expect to be alive for another 50-60 years, wouldn’t it be a good investment to spend a few years learning the language Paul, Luke, John and others spoke and wrote in?

            <content type="html">
              Using Chef with small Django apps This year at DjangoCon, it seemed like everybody was talking about automatic deployments and namely Chef. After coming home from the conference, I spent a considerable amount of time learning chef and thinking about how it can be best used with small to medium size Django apps. In this post, I will walk you through how Chef works and how it can help you make awesome web apps. When I say small apps, I mean single-server deployments. This means that your web server, your database, memcached, rabbitmq, etc is installed on a single Ubuntu VM. When learning Chef, I found that most of the available tutorials focus on multi-server setups and are too complex for ordinary apps. Unfortunately, Chef is written in Ruby and it can be a little tricky to debug since all the tracebacks are meaningless to a Python developer. However, don’t despair, you can usually tell pretty quickly what’s going on. To test your deployment, we will be using Vagrant which is an awesome tool for running virtual machines on your development machine. What we will install Our Django application will be deployed using the following: nginx gunicorn postgresql memcached rabbitmq git Your development machine will need to have Fabric installed. How Chef works Chef is a tool that is installed on your server. You give it a bunch configuration files and tell it to provision server with the necessary packages and settings. This means that our automatic deployment will have to parts: Chef configuration files for the sever, and several Fabric tasks to install Chef remotely and start the provisioning process. So, to configure Chef, we will create a deploy directory inside our project’s repository. I like to keep the following structure: $ ls -a .git coolapp docs deploy README.md Vagrantfile fabfile.py … where coolapp is your Django project. We will focus on the deploy directory and the fabfile. Chef is a cook how prepares your server for dinner. So, Chef needs some cookbooks and recipes. Each cookbook is a directory that contains various configuration files for a specific application that you want installed. So for example, you will have a PostgreSQL cookbook and a nginx cookbook. The deploy directory will contain a directory called cookbooks which will contain all other cookbooks. Now, the good news is that you don’t have to make the cookbooks yourself. Opscode, the company behind Chef, maintains a large selection of cookbooks on Github. You can copy and paste the cookbooks you need for you project. We will need the following: build-essential (for building from source) erlang (rabbitmq depends on this) git memcached nginx postgresql python (for virtualenv and python header files) rabbitmq Cookbooks Each cookbook contains a recipes directory. Each recipe tells Chef how this particular application is to be installed and configured. For example, it will tell nginx to create an entry in sites-available and sites-enabled. Or, it will restart PostreSQL when it’s done being installed. There is also a files directory and a templates directory. Templates are Ruby templates which define a particular configuration file. For example, in order for Chef to be able to properly configure nginx with the proper server name, it needs to know on what domain your application will be hosted. More on this later, but there is a master file which has all your settings in it and Chef reads from that and substitutes the necessary values. The files directory contains files that need no further modification and can be copied over verbatim. node.json The node.json file is a per project file that specifies certain values for Chef to use. For example, you can tell Chef what you want your PostgreSQL database to be called, what the name of your django project is, etc. It has a simple JSON syntax. Your app’s recipe Your application is going to need a simple recipe. This means creating a cookbook bearing your project’s name and creating a recipes directory within in. The recipe should be called default.rb and all it needs to include is a list of applications to install. For example: # Example django app cookbook execute &#34;Update apt repos&#34; do command &#34;apt-get update&#34; end include_recipe &#39;nginx&#39; include_recipe &#39;build-essential&#39; include_recipe &#39;python&#39; include_recipe &#39;postgresql::server&#39; include_recipe &#39;memcached&#39; include_recipe &#39;runit&#39; include_recipe &#39;git&#39; execute &#34;restart postgres&#34; do command &#34;sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.4 restart&#34; end execute &#34;create-database&#34; do command &#34;createdb -U postgres -O postgres #{node[:dbname]}&#34; end You can see it’s pretty simple. We update Ubuntu’s repositories, include some recipes, restart PostgreSQL and create a new database. Start the engines At this point, you can try out your configuration with Vagrant. To help you out, I have create a template project on Github that you can download and use out of the box. The next big part is writing the Fabric scripts. You will want the following tasks: Install Chef Transfer the cookbooks directory to the server Bootstrap the Django project Moving code to the server Creating a virtualenv Installing requirements Syncing the database Running migrations Starting gunicorn Deploy You can see how I implemented mine here. I recommend that you use Fabric’s roledefs which will allow you to specify vagrant as the host: $ fab -R vagrant bootstrap The real thing Once you’ve tested your application in Vagrant so you are ready to deploy to a server. All that’s left to do is create a new roledef in the fabfile and run it! Conclusion I am by no means a Chef expert—I learned how to use it a few days ago. If you have any feedback, do let me know.

              Google APIs - Y U NO WORK Recently, at SheepDogInc, I have been working with various Google APIs, especially the Calendar API. The state of these APIs is rather unfortunate. Google is a web giant and you’d think that their APIs would be state-of-the-art given the number of professionals they employ. Documentation Before we go anywhere, let me just talk about the documentation for a minute. As an open-source software author and advocate, I always encourage developers to write extensive and good documentation. Somehow, Google didn’t get the demo. Most of their documentation is sparse, incorrect and out-of-date. If you would like to know what data a call returns, you’re better off just making the call and inspecting the response. This will actually save you time because the docs are probably wrong anyway. Reliability Google is like the master of scalability. They have an estimated one million servers world-wide. And yet, they cannot consistently return a 200 to an API call. I have written horrible, horrible glue code and hacky workarounds to account for this unpredictability. Sometimes you will get a response, sometimes it will timeout, sometime you will get a 404… Engineering With all these amazing engineers, can Google really not make a better API? Honestly, if I was in a position to hire a person who worked on the Google API team, I would think twice. Seriously — test your app, keep your docs up-to-date, and mainly, stop pissing me off!

              DjangoCon 2011 Take-Aways My employer, SheepDogInc, sent me and a colleague of mine to DjangoCon 2011. It was my first developer conference and I had a blast. Here a few quick points about what the conference has clarified for me. Deploying Django Despite the Django official documentation’s recommendation to use Apache and mod_wsgi, most people seem to deploy Django with nginx and gunicorn. This has been a pleasant surprise to me because I like it but though that it was too simple (or less robust than Apache). Provisioning servers It seemed that everybody was talking about Chef and automatic deployments. Instead of manually connecting to a server via ssh, you can run one command which will install all the necessary packages for your application (nginx, postgresql, etc) and configure them. It makes the whole process less error-prone. Also, you’re more likely to spin up a new VM on your development machine to try things out because you don’t have to thing about setting it up. Especially with tools like vagrant, it’s dead easy. Pronouncing things When you read names of technical products, you can’t always be sure how it’s supposed to be pronounced. PyPI: pie-pee-eye PyPy: pie-pie wsgi: wizz-gy nginx: engine-x Did you go to DjangoCon 2011? What are your thoughts?

              The pre-GPS world When I was a kid, our family used to travel a lot. I grew up in central Europe and over the years, we visited most of continental Europe. This was in the early ‘90s. Usually, Mom would have a map on her lap and she would tell Dad where to go. To keep me and my little brother entertained, they gave us another map and we would follow along. We had fun trying to pronounce funny city names and calculating distances that we had travelled that day. Mostly, we had fun travelling in the car. Sometimes, we would get lost though and tension in the car would rise. My brother and I were always trying to help get us unlost. I remember thinking that it would be so cool to have a tiny little car on the map to show you where you were so you’d always know where you were going. Now, some fifteen years later, GPS units are very common. A dream come true?

            <id>https://honza.ca/2011/07/why-i-love-restructuredtext</id>

            <content type="html">
              Why I love reStructuredText A lot of geeks are using Markdown as their markup generation tool today. It’s simple, effective and used everywhere. It allows you to focus on your content and not on the HTML code that will be used to display the content on a web page. I have used Markdown extensively and its simplicity is appealing to me. reStructuredText is similar to Markdown. If you know Markdown, it’s dead simple to learn to use RST. So, why bother? There are many things it can do that Markdown simple wasn’t designed to do. Let me give you a bit of a background. As a programmer, I like to write and save documents in text files, using the vim editor. This way I can easily keep track of different versions of those documents and I will always be able to open them. The problem is that most non-technical people, such as my family or perhaps your clients, are trained to use Word documents or PDF files. Most computer users wouldn’t know what to do with that file and wouldn’t understand the syntax. I was looking for a way to write my documents in text files and still be able to share those with others via Word/PDF. At first, I set up simple LaTex templates. Then, I thought about writing a script to parse Markdown files to PDF via ReportLab. All very cumbersome and not quite right. Then, I dicovered RST. It’s written in Python which means that any customizations won’t be impossible. When I installed it, I was surprised that it came with a set of command line tools to parse RST files to other common formats such as: HTML PDF via Latex ODT (OpenOffice format) I played around a bit with the tools and found them useful, but not great. The default formatting was ugly and it seemed like it would take too much work to manually edit the embedded CSS/Latex/ODT styles. I read through the documentation more and found out that you can set up global or project specific configuration files that RST parsers will look for by default. The syntax is simple and effective. This way, you only set up your styles once and then all you have to do to convert those styles is $ rst2html.py doc.rst &gt; doc.html RST is extensible and you can configure it to do almost anything you want. Once good example is Pygments syntax highlighting. You can add a new directive and automatically run your code examples through Pygments. Or, you can customize the LaTex writer to use a specific font, page size and lots more.

            <content type="html">
              On prayer and the closing of the eyes Virtually every Christian has been taught that prayer is when you talk to God with your eyes closed. We tell our children, “Close your eyes and we will pray”. The idea of having your eyes closed when you pray is so engrained in our culture that we don’t give it a second thought. As protestant Christians, we believe that the Bible contains actual words of God. We also believe in the sufficiency of the Bible’s instruction. Let’s survey the Scriptures and see what the proper mode and posture is when we pray. In the English Standard Version translation of the Bible, the word pray occurs ninety times. Fifty-three times of that is in the New Testament. These verses describe prayer as urgent and emotional. For example, the Psalmist exclaims: Give attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you do I pray. (Psalm 5:2, ESV) In the New Testament, the disciples ask Jesus to teach them how to pray. The apostle Paul prays for his coworkers in the gospel. Jesus often prayed in private, away from the crowds. However, we are not told any specifics. Jesus also prayed in public. For example, in the story of feeding of the five thousand: Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. (Matthew 14:19, ESV) Jesus is looking up to heaven, possibly stretching his arms and is speaking to his father. The lifting of hands or arms is also described in 1 Timothy where Paul is telling Timothy how a church service should be conducted: I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling; (1 Timothy 2:8, ESV) The Bible records many occasions where people pray to their God but in no instance does it describe or prescribe that the believer’s eyes be closed. Why do we do it then? I can think of a few different reasons. One, we don’t want to embarrass the one leading the prayer; two, it helps us focus on the task at hand; or, three, we want others around us to know that we are praying and shouldn’t be disturbed. These reasons are understandable and certainly not sinful in any way. But I do believe that we rob ourselves of some joy by closing our eyes. If we only ever pray with our eyes closed, we won’t pray very often. Prayer becomes a holy moment that we plan ahead. Your prayer life should be an ongoing conversation with your Father. Jesus prayed constantly. And so need we.

              What is a blog? I have noticed that many people don’t know what a blog is, so I would like to talk about that briefly. A blog is a type of website or part of a website. Blogs are usually maintained by an individual with regular entries. (…) Entries are commonly displayed in reverse-chronological order. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog. Source: Wikipedia A blog is a website. A blog has many entries or posts. To write a post means to update your existing blog with a new article. To create or write a new blog means to start a new website. Please, don’t say that you are going write a blog when you mean you will write a post. That would be wrong. OK?

              Why I don’t like the Ruby community I write Python and Javascript code. I use Django and jQuery. And I cringe every time I have to run gem install x. I only have a limited understanding of Ruby and hardly any of Ruby on Rails. It seems disorganized to me and hard to process. All this is fine – I don’t have to use any of it if I don’t like it, right? I always knew there was something wrong with the way Ruby works. I don’t mean wrong like murdering children, I just mean wrong like I don’t know why things are the way they are. There are a lot of talented Ruby programmers and I don’t mean to dismiss that. Recently, though, I came across a tweet that I made me realize what it was that I didn’t like about Ruby. It was like a small revelation. Markup is markup, not Ruby. JavaScript is JavaScript, not Ruby. CSS is CSS, not Ruby. Get that in your head before I slap you. - @ara_p Do you get it? ERB is Ruby with some html-like fragments mixed in. CoffeeScript is a Ruby-like language that compiles to Javascript. Sass is a Ruby-like language for writing css files. Before you know it, everything will be in Ruby.

            <id>https://honza.ca/2011/05/deploying-django-with-nginx-and-gunicorn</id>

            <content type="html">
              Deploying Django with nginx and gunicorn The amazing Django documentation recommends that you use Apache and modwsgi to deploy your webapp. While this is certainly not bad advice, you may not want to use Apache after all. Apache is a beast that eats up a lot of memory, is kind of slow and can’t handle as much traffic. As a fun alternative, I would like to talk about deploying Django on nginx using the gunicorn web server. Just a quick note before we start: this isn’t an out-there deployment option. I spoke to one of the gunicorn developers and was told that every django hosting company (think ep.io) uses this setup. Get your server ready I use Rackspace for small, single server web apps. I created an Ubuntu 10.10 instance with 256MB of RAM. Then, I created a user for my app and added my ssh key to authorized_keys. Basic stuff. Install nginx Installing nginx couldn’t be simpler. Latest stable release is provided via a ppa repository. $ sudo apt-get install python-software-properties -y $ sudo -s $ apt-add-repository ppa:nginx/stable $ apt-get update $ apt-get install nginx $ exit Project structure The user under which the app will run is webapp, so I checkout my app in /home/webapp. /home/webapp/app /home/webapp/app/static /home/webapp/env Note that I’m using virtualenv to deploy this app. Configure nginx and gunicorn The following two files can be distributed with your project. nginx.conf: server { listen 80; server_name webapp.org; access_log /home/webapp/access.log; error_log /home/webapp/error.log; location /static { root /home/webapp/app; } location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888; } } Next, I symlinked nginx.conf to the server’s sites-enabled directory. $ sudo ln -s /home/webapp/app/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enable/webapp.org This sets up nginx to directly serve the applications’s static files (css, js, etc.). Everything else is proxied to the gunicorn server. Now gunicorn is a Python HTTP server. It’s super simple and effective. I installed it into the app’s environment. $ (env) pip install gunicorn gunicorn.conf.py: bind = &#34;127.0.0.1:8888&#34; logfile = &#34;/home/webapp/gunicorn.log&#34; workers = 3 That’s it! The config files are simple and easy to read. Running I then collected all the static files into the static directory: $ (env) python manage.py collectstatic I restarted nginx: $ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart And finally, I ran the gunicorn server: $ (env) cd /home/webapp/app $ (env) gunicorn_django -D -c gunicorn.conf.py And I was good to go. Notes You may have to change the permissions on the static directory. Also, the command above starts gunicorn as a deamon - a better way would be to use a monitoring service to start it. Think runit or supervisord. Also, I didn’t include any database specific configurations since that’s indentical to an Apache deployment.

            <content type="html">
              The importance of git rebase Git isn’t just something you have to put up with when working with other developers. Git is a wonderful tool that allows you to manage your code, its evolution and help you recover from mistakes should they arise. One of the things that people are intimidated by is git rebase. Let’s look at an example. You’re working on a team with two other developers. You have a blessed repository that sits on your company’s server. Everyone is working on the same project but on slightly different tasks. Everyone is working on the master branch. You write a bit of code here and there, you commit a bunch of times and then it’s time to share your code with the rest of the team by pushing it up to the shared repository. You run git push but receive an error saying that there are changes on the server and your commit cannot be fast-forwarded. No big deal, right? You run git pull to download the changes that you don’t have and automatically merge your changes in. Then you can git push again and it will work just fine. The problem is that it makes the history of your project messy. * 9:35 - Nancy - Merge branch &#39;master&#39; |\ * | 9:35 - Nancy - Second commit | | | * 9:30 - Brad - First commit |/ * 9:12 - Nancy - First commit As you can see, there is this strange Merge branch ‘master’ commit that’s a little out of place. If everyone on your team is regularly pushing to the shared repository, the history gets littered with these weird commits pretty quickly. You may have guessed that there is a better way. We’ll replay the above scenario using git rebase. Instead of running git pull, we will run git pull –rebase. What this will do is temporarily hide the commits that only you have, then pull the changes from the remote repository, fast-forward (no merge commit) and then re-apply your commits on top of the current HEAD. The end result from a code point of view is the same, but the history is much cleaner: * 9:35 - Nancy - Second commit * 9:30 - Brad - First commit * 9:12 - Nancy - First commit See? Isn’t this so much better? The only difference to your current workflow is that instead of git pull you will run git pull –rebase. Easy!

            <id>https://honza.ca/2011/05/the-modern-web-developer-and-open-source-licenses</id>

            <content type="html">
              The modern web developer and open source licenses The world of open source is full of wonders. People write code for free and make it available for free for anyone to use. If you write a quick little program on the weekend, it’s usually because there is a need that has to be filled. There’s a repetitive task that you wish you didn’t have to do so you write a short program to do it for you. Web development can be hard. You have to worry about your database, your server-side code, your client-side templates and javascript and it all has to magically work together. We web developers have created a ton of tools to help us get the job done. And those of us who are really commited to the best and most reliable software make what we create in our spare time available for everyone else to use. We share the awesome idea we had in hopes that someone had the same problem and we could help them solve it. Massive projects like Django and Ruby on Rails come to mind. jQuery and Prototype. Fabric and Capistrano. The list just goes on. The world of open source is full of wonders. All of this is possible by releasing our code under a license. And not just any license. If you were to publish your code online without describing how it can be used, by default you are reserving all the rights to yourself. Nobody else can legally use it. You as the creator have the right and responsibility to decide how your code will be used. I was introduced to the world of open source by Linux and the GNU movement. For the longest time, I would claim that the only true open source license is the GPL. It’s a great license. It ensures that your software will never be used in a non-free way (free as in freedom). It works great for medium to large scale pieces of software, such as the Linux kernel or git. The two are self contained and don’t usually have any dependencies. However, the more I moved from desktop software development towards developing for the web, the more I found myself frustrated and confused by the GPL. If a user downloads a web page generated by a GPL-covered web framework, do I need to also make available to the user the code that generated the page? If I use jQuery on my page (which is released under the GPL) and my scripts use it, do I have to provide non-minified versions of my scripts? Can I legally use a GPL-covered web framework to build a website for client and not make the source code available? There are plenty more options to think about and my head starts to hurt every time I try to make a sense of it all. I believe that the General Public License is unsuitable for web-based projects such as web frameworks, javascript libraries, etc. In a modern web application, there are way too many moving parts created by different parties. It’s the web developer’s job to find the best tools to get their job done. I believe that the best tools available today are of the open source variety (MS SQL server, anyone?). I was reading Jeff Atwood’s article on software licenses and became convinced that I should abandon the GPL for my projects. After all, I want people to use my software and making them try and understand the intricacies of the legal language of the GPL is unnecessary. Starting today, I will make my projects available under the terms of a more permissive license. My current favorites are: BSD MIT WTFPL They are all short and easy to understand. Peoples’ time is expensive, let’s not waste it. If you are a developer and you maintain a project that’s useful for making the web a better place, I would ask that you consider using a permissive license for your project. Update (2012-01-09): After reading Van Lindberg’s book on Open source licenses, I have learned that the WTFPL isn’t a good idea. It doesn’t actually do anything in terms of legal protection or warranty.

            <content type="html">
              Virtual machines for Django developers Vagrant is a tool for building and distributing virtualized development environments. It’s based on VirtualBox VMs. This article describes how this Ruby tool can be useful to Django developers. Why vagrant? The modern web developer works on many different projects. Each project has a unique set of requirements, dependencies and package versions needed for that project to succeed. Keeping all of these libraries in check is difficult. virtualenv is a tool that creates isolated environments for Python packages. Vagrant takes this approach a step further. You can virtualize the entire server. Just as each Django project will have a requirements.txt file which lists the project’s pip dependencies, your project will now have a Vagrantfile and a cookbooks directory. The Vagrantfile describes how the VM should be created and the cookbooks directory contains instructions on what packages to install. For example, in the Vagrantfile you will specify a VM which runs an Ubuntu server with 256MB of RAM and your cookbooks directory will tell vagrant to install apache2, git, postgresql and memcached. Getting started with vagrant is simple. Getting started vagrant is distributed as a Ruby gem and you can install it like so: gem install vagrant Next, you will download a base box that I made for you. It’s an Ubuntu 10.10 server with minimal configuration. vagrant box add vagrant-ubuntu http://honza.ca/downloads/vagrant-ubuntu.box This will take a while so you may want to get a beverage. Next, you will create a directory that will hold your project and initialize it for vagrant. cd ~/Code mkdir webapp cd webapp vagrant init vagrant-ubuntu This will create a Vagrantfile in that directory. And then run vagrant up to actually build and boot the environment. This might take a few minutes. After this, your environment is running. Your environment is a headless virtualbox instance. You can ssh into the box by running: vagrant ssh You will notice that your project directory (webapp) is mounted inside the environment under /vagrant. Any changes to either directory will affect the other. You can shutdown your environment with vagrant halt Destroy it with: vagrant destroy Provisioning Next, you will install some packages into the VM. You will install some common Django packages: PostreSQL, Apache, WSGI, memcached and git. cd ~/Code/webapp git clone git@github.com:honza/cookbooks.git This downloads all kinds of cookbooks ready for our use. We will create a custom cookbook inside that directory where we will define what packages we want: cd cookbooks mkdir webapp cd webapp mkdir recipes touch recipes/default.rb Now open up the default.rb file and enter the following: require_recipe &#34;postgresql::server&#34; require_recipe &#34;apache2&#34; include_recipe &#34;apache2::#{node[:django][:web_server]}&#34; require_recipe &#34;git&#34; require_recipe &#34;memcached&#34; And modify your Vagrantfile to use the cookbooks: Vagrant::Config.run do |config| config.vm.box = &#34;vagrant-ubuntu&#34; config.vm.provision :chef_solo do |chef| chef.cookbooks_path = &#34;cookbooks&#34; chef.add_recipe &#34;webapp&#34; end end For the configuration changes to take effect, you need to run: vagrant reload OK, that concludes our quick introduction to Vagrant. I hope you see how this can be beneficial and how simple it is to get started.

            <title>Why you should be using CoffeeScript</title>

            <link href="https://honza.ca/2011/04/why-you-should-be-using-coffeescript"/>

            <id>https://honza.ca/2011/04/why-you-should-be-using-coffeescript</id>

            <content type="html">
              Why you should be using CoffeeScript I’m sure you’ve heard of CoffeeScript. Everyone is talking about it, it seems. It’s a beautiful language with a simple syntax that you use to write Javascript. CoffeeScript compiles to Javascript. Here is why I think you should be using it: Readability CoffeeScript is designed to be beautiful and readable. There is no unnecessary fluff. Less syntax boilerplate, fewer mistakes. Compare: // regular javascript var author = &#34;William Shakespeare&#34;; // coffeescript author = &#34;William Shakespeare&#34; Indentation is also important in CoffeeScript - just like in Python. This makes closures and blocks easier to spot. Valid Code There are many different coding styles when it comes to writing Javascript. The good thing about CoffeeScript is that the Javascript it generates is valid - it passes Javascript Lint. And if your code isn’t valid CoffeeScript, it won’t compile. It’s a win-win. This is perhaps my favorite feature. Easy class inheritance This is just great. It reminds me of Python and Ruby: class Animal constructor: (@name) -&gt; move: (meters) -&gt; alert @name + &#34; moved #{meters}m.&#34; class Dog extends Animal move: -&gt; alert &#34;Whoof...&#34; super 5 Compiles to this in Javascript: var Animal, Dog; var __hasProp = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty, __extends = function(child, parent) { for (var key in parent) { if (__hasProp.call(parent, key)) child[key] = parent[key]; } function ctor() { this.constructor = child; } ctor.prototype = parent.prototype; child.prototype = new ctor; child.__super__ = parent.prototype; return child; }; Animal = (function() { function Animal(name) { this.name = name; } Animal.prototype.move = function(meters) { return alert(this.name + (&#34; moved &#34; + meters + &#34;m.&#34;)); }; return Animal; })(); Dog = (function() { function Dog() { Dog.__super__.constructor.apply(this, arguments); } __extends(Dog, Animal); Dog.prototype.move = function() { alert(&#34;Whoof...&#34;); return Dog.__super__.move.call(this, 5); }; return Dog; })(); Quite a difference, huh? Think how much time you’d need to understand each version and make any changes required. In my mind, this encourages better code organization and structure. Node.js awesomeness CoffeeScript comes with a Node.js utility, coffee. You can write your Node.js code in CoffeeScript and run it with coffee file.js. The utility wraps the CoffeeScript compiler and the node executable. This way, you can whip up a quick server in no time. Genius. Easy debugging With tools like Google Web Toolkit, your code compiles to minified javascript. Non-minified code is obviously easier (possible?) to read and debug.

              The latest greatest technology I just found an interesting quote by Thomas Fuchs, the creator of script.aculo.us and a core member of the Prototype team. The quote is from his Setup interview: For computer programmers, especially if you’re self-employed, there’s no excuse whatsoever not to get the latest and greatest. You don’t really have other expenses anyway, it’s tax-deductible and, most importantly, it will make you happy and more productive if you know that you’re using the best available tools.

            <content type="html">
              JSLint syntax checker for vim Douglas Crockford’s JSLint script is almost a golden standard when it comes to checking the syntax and general sanity of your javascript files. Being lazy by nature, I got tired of copying and pasting my code into the web form. I wanted to be able to run the JSLint tool from the command line. JSLint itself is written in javascript. It’s a 6000-line beast. How do you run a javascript library as a command line utility? The answer is node.js. I wrote a quick little script that takes a single argument (your file) and runs JSLint over it, printing any errors to the console. I call it jslintnode.js and the code is on Github. Well, checking my files from the command line is certainly better than using the web interface. But I still have to run it over and over. As you may know, I’m fanatical vim user. There is a cool plugin called syntastic which runs through the file you are editing each time you save it. It puts little &gt;&gt;&gt; characters next to the line you are editing which tells you that you screwed up and need to fix that line. However, by default, syntastic uses the jsl utility to check javascript files. With a little bit of work, you can modify the original script to use our jslintnode.js utility. Go into the /syntax_checkers/ directory and open up the javascript.vim file. Change this line: if !executable(&#39;jsl&#39;) to this: if !executable(&#39;jslintnode.js&#39;) And replace the body of the SyntaxCheckers_javascript_GetLocList() function with the following: let makeprg = &#34;jslintnode.js &#34;.shellescape(expand(&#39;%&#39;)) let errorformat=&#39;%W%f(%l): lint warning: %m,%-Z%p^,%W%f(%l): warning: %m,%-Z%p^,%E%f(%l): SyntaxError: %m,%-Z%p^,%-G&#39; return SyntasticMake({ &#39;makeprg&#39;: makeprg, &#39;errorformat&#39;: errorformat }) Save and restart vim. That’s it. Now as you’re editing any javascript files you will get instant feedback as to the quality of your code as judged by JSLint. And remember that JSLint will hurt your feelings.

            <content type="html">
              The Irrationality of Being an Apple Fanboy It continues to amaze me how much people devote themselves to Apple products. Every time the fruit company releases a new product, people line in front of the store for days in hopes of being one of the first blessed people who get to touch the shiny new toy. The Oatmeal has an awesome comic about this. Being all crazy and sleeping on the sidewalk aside, let’s look at more of a down-to-earth example. Being a geek and all, I get asked rather often if I would recommend someone buys a Mac laptop. While I wholeheartadly agree that the Unix-like qualities of Mac OSX are infinitely superior to the (non) qualities of the Windows kernel, I cannot recommend to my friends that they buy a laptop with an apple on it. Here is why. I went on the FutureShop website to see what brand new laptops cost these days and how powerful they are. First, I looked up the cheapest 15’ Macbook Pro. Here are the specs: Intel Core i5 2.53GHz 4GB RAM 500GB HDD Intel HD Graphics Card Price: $1,699.95 Then, I looked for a solid laptop that could compete with the Macbook Pro. I didn’t want to compare it to laptops of questionable quality like those made by Acer or HP. I went for a Sony Vaio: Intel Core i5 2.53GHz 4GB RAM 500GB HDD Intel HD Graphics Card Price: $899 I’m sure you will have noticed that the two computers have the exact same specs. However, the Macbook is almost double the price. I say, buy the Vaio and install Ubuntu on it. Rock solid laptop with a rock solid OS. You can also buy your wife a netbook or an iPad with the money you save. Let the flaming begin.

            <content type="html">
              7 ways Github has changed the open source world As the guys at the changelog say, the world of open source is changing fast and you have to keep up. I believe that Github has been very influential when it comes to making open source more accessible. How has Github changed the world of open source? Force projects to include a good README Apart from the directory structure and files, the most prominent element on the page is your README file. If you don’t have one, the page looks kind of weird. As an administrator, if you don’t add a README file, Github will start yelling at you. Unified place for all your projects When I come across a cool project, I like to see what other stuff the author has been hacking on. The best example I think is tpope who is a famous vim plugin creator. When you go to his profile page on Github, you can see all of the plugins he has ever written and published. Code discussions Yes, you can discuss the project on IRC or on mailing lists. Those aren’t exactly user friendly, and it’s hard to discuss code that way. Github makes it easy for you to submit a pull request and have others comment on your code. Publish your hacks with ease Did you just write a patch that greatly improves an existing project? Fork it and publish it in minutes. If you notify the original project, you can get helpful feedback on your hacks. This encourages people to publish their code even if it’s never merged into the original project. Judge how active a project is Github makes it easy to quickly look through a project’s history to see how active it is. In no time, you can tell how many people commit to it and how often. Also, the number of watchers/forks in the corner gives you a pretty good idea of how many people are actually using the project. This is possibly my favorite feature. Open source developers don’t need to waste their time exploring libraries that aren’t maintained. Discover new projects Smart people come up with clever things all the time. If they share their code on Github, you can find it in the Explore Github section. I can’t remember how many times I’ve discovered a cool project this way. My favorite example is CoffeeScript. Follow the development of your favorite projects When you first log in, you are presented with a list of changes that were made to the projects you follow. This projects has a new release, this bug was fixed. etc. Invaluable. What are your thoughts? Any favorite features of Github?

              How To Convert Vim Colorschemes To Pygments Themes Recently, I have grown to love Pygments. It gives you syntax highlighting in the browser without heavy Javascript files. It supports just about any programming language on the planet and it’s just plain awesome. The only thing that it’s lacking is good color schemes. It comes with a dozen themes that will certainly do the trick, but if you’re used to looking at pretty code in your favorite editor, the code examples on your website will look a little dull. I’m going to go out on a limb here and assume you have a favorite colorscheme. I found a script that will turn a vim colorscheme into a Pygments theme. It didn’t work perfectly out of the box so I patched it. You can download it here. Copy your vim colorscheme to the same directory as the script and run it like so: $ python vim2pygments.py molokai.vim &gt; molokai.py This will produce a Python file containing a simple style class that Pygments can use. Next step is to download Pygments: $ hg clone http://dev.pocoo.org/hg/pygments-main pygments And then you will install your new theme: $ cd pygments $ cp ../molokai.py pygments/styles/molokai.py OK, now for the fun part. We will use Pygments to generate the CSS file that you will then use on your website: $ ./pygmentize -S molokai -f html -a .highlight &gt; molokai.css If you are a TextMate user, you might be able to get your favorite theme done, too. A lot of popular Vim colorschemes are inspired by TextMate. Sunburst, mustang and idle fingers come to mind. Just find a Vim version and you’re good to go. That’s it!

              Why Nokia chose Windows over Android Today, we have all heard about the new deal struck between Nokia and Microsoft. It is a major change in Nokia’s strategy which will without a doubt affect the smartphone market. A few month ago, the Executive Vice President of Nokia announced that switching to Android is like peeing in your boots for warmth. Well, let me say this: if switching to Android is like peeing in your boots, switching to Windows is like shitting your pants. Perhaps, Nokia liked the latter better.

              How My Website Works I’m sure you’ve heard of static site generators like Jekyll (Ruby) or Hyde (Python). The benefits are obvious - your site is hosted on a cheap shared hosting and it can easily survive the Digg/Slashdot/Reddit effect. There is no database latency - the browser requests a file on the server and gets it back immediately. Update (2011-02-27): While I still use a static generator to power my site, it’s not a different engine. I got tired of launching a django server just to write a post. I wrote a new static site generator called Socrates. Each post is now a separate file written in Markdown. Socrates then runs through those files and creates a site for me. I’m still using django templates. What follows is the original post. django The site is a simple django blog. There is nothing really of note when it comes to django-specific coding. I run the django server locally when I’m editing or adding articles. It provides a nice UI. It also lets me easily preview the site without generating anything. static generator When I’m happy with the state of the website and want to publish it, I run the static generator. It’s contained in the generate.py file. It runs through all possible urls and for each one it generates a static file. Each file is a complete HTML page that the user’s browser will download. The folder structure is as follows: /2010/ /02/ post-one.html post-two.html /2011/ .. .. /about/ index.html index.html /page/ /2/ index.html /category/ /android/ index.html /code/ index.html .. You get the idea. This way, with an .htaccess file we can have the following URL structure: /2010/02/post-one/ FTP deploy script And the final piece is the deploy.py script. It looks at the deploy directory, and with a little help from git, it figures out what files were changed since the last deploy. It then takes those files and throws them up on the server. A normal shared hosting. Conclusion You can check out the code on Github.

              Android Development disappointments The Android platform is the latest buzz in the smartphone world. I have previously written on why I prefer Android over iPhone. In this article, we will talk a little bit about what it’s like to develop native applications for Android. Android SDK uses Java. I know Java but it’s not my favorite. After working with Python and Django for months, going back to Java isn’t exactly easy. But it’s not undoable either. Being from the Czech republic, I thought I would try to target the Czech market. Android is starting to get really big over there. I decided to write a simple news reader application for one of the leading news portals called iDnes (“eToday”). The application downloads an RSS feed, parses it and displays a list of news articles to the user. The user has the option to choose their topic, and to manually refresh the application to get new articles. Not very complicated at all. It took me a few evenings to put it together. The development process was quite fun. The Android SDK integration into Eclipse is awesome. It tells you when you have to implement additional methods, or automatically adds your imports when it’s needed. As part of the SDK, you get a simulator for all kinds of versions of Android (from 1.5 to 2.2). This way, you can test your application on various versions of the API. I read all the articles on packaging and distributing. I made sure my application was backwards compatible. I tried to follow their guidelines for app icons as much as I could (well, I suck at graphic design). I exported the applications, signed it, aligned it and uploaded it to the Android Market. I was excited. I did it. I published my first Android applications. But then came the disappointment. My app started to get a lot of bad comments in the market. People complained that the application didn’t do anything, and they couldn’t read any news, etc. I didn’t come across any errors like that during testing. If the applications doesn’t have internet, it will tell the user it doesn’t have internet. If there is a problem, it will let them know. As a developer and author, I feel there is no way for me to receive helpful information about the errors the users are getting when they are interacting with the application. OK, that’s it. If you have any comments or suggestions, do let me know in the comments.

              Apple Finally Catches Up To Linux Apple recently unveiled their newest venture. It’s called the App Store, and I’m sure you’ve heard of it. It’s a place on your computer that lets you download and discover new applications. Just like the package manager on most Linux distributions. Except Linux has had ‘app stores’ for years. Welcome to 21st century computing, Apple.

              How Money Is Made Online My friends of the non-geek type often ask me how companies like Facebook can make so much money and provide their service for free at the same time. Here is a quick example of how you can make money online. Warning: this is a not a get rich quick scheme. I’m not going teach you how to make millions working for Google from home. I recently started following John Gruber’s blog Darring Fireball. This gentleman seems to be rather influential in the hacker community. On the website, he says that there are more than 400,000 subscribers that frequently read his blog. In the world of Internet publishing, this is a great deal of exposure. Not very many people get this much attention. If you browse through the site, you will soon notice that you can sponsor John to write more articles. You can pay him $5,000/month - in return, a small banner with your company’s advertising graphics will be displayed in a prominent place on John’s blog for that month. You will get millions of people every month looking at your ad for just $5,000/month. Writing interesting articles about the web is a full-time job for John.

              Why I Chose Android Recently, we have heard that the Android operating system has the largest market share in the US, and is set to take over the whole world. Personally, I chose Android long before it was this popular. Why? Background I won’t bore you with my personal history, but I’d like to say a few things. I’m a programmer and like to tweet things. If there isn’t an application that does the job, I write it myself. Couple years ago, I was given the then amazing iPhone 3G. I was thrilled. Everyone wanted one, and I had it. Motorola Droid I sold the iPhone, and bought a Motorola Droid. Why? It’s actually pretty simple. I don’t like closed systems. If you want to develop an application for the iPhone, you have to buy an Apple computer. You have to use XCode, the objective-C IDE. And only after your application gets approved, you can use it on your phone. I don’t like the idea of spending an upwards of $1,000 to get an underpowered machine just to be able to write an app. Blackberry After deciding, I wanted to get off the iPhone train, I started looking around for a new smartphone. The first choice was Blackberry. A serious Canadian company, business-class smartphones, good prices, … What’s not to like? Well, it turns out that you need Microsoft Windows in order to properly develop and test your Blackberry application. Being an avid Linux user, I very much disliked the idea of going back to Windows just because of Blackberry. Enter Android Android was my next choice. I browsed over to the developers’ website to see if I can make apps for this platform. When I saw that Windows, Mac OS and Linux were supported, I almost cried for joy! I learned that Android runs on the Linux kernel, apps are written in Java using the open source SDK. Google Yes, Google is behind this whole thing. You may not exactly care unless you use their services. The integration of Google services into Android is phenomenal. When you first turn on your device, you are asked to enter your Google account information, and the device takes care of the rest. Your email, contacts, calendar, Google Talk, etc. are set up automatically. Genius.

            <title>How To Use Twitter OAuth On Android</title>

            <content type="html">
              How To Use Twitter OAuth On Android If you are developing an application for the Android platform, and you need to interact with the Twitter API, you now have to use OAuth to authenticate the user. In this article, we will have a look on how you can do that. What is OAuth? OAuth is a way of accessing a user’s data (e.g. tweets) without asking for the user’s username and password. Your application opens the Twitter website which will ask the user if they want to allow you to access their data. If they do, they are taken back to the application and can start using it. You can find more about OAuth all over the web. Prerequisites There are a couple of .jars that you will need for this to work. signpost-commonshttp4-1.2.1.1.jar signpost-core-1.2.1.1.jar You can download them here. Basic Activity Let’s say we have an activity running where the user can start the authentication process. There is nothing special about this activity, except for some text and a button. When the user clicks the button, the OAuth process will be started. From the button’s onClickListener() we will call the startOAuth() method of our activity. We will add a few attributes to our activity. Let’s call the activity Main. public class Main extends Activity { private CommonsHttpOAuthConsumer httpOauthConsumer; private OAuthProvider httpOauthprovider; public final static String consumerKey = &#34;abc&#34;; public final static String consumerSecret = &#34;abc&#34;; private final String CALLBACKURL = &#34;app://twitter&#34;; @Override public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) { super.onCreate(savedInstanceState); ... } consumerKey and consumerSecret will store your app’s unique keys that you will get from Twitter. CALLBACK is a little different. This is used when the application is authorized on the web, and the control is returned back to the Main activity. For the mobile browser to be able to call the application and tell it that the OAuth business has gone well, it needs a call back. Both app and twitter can be exchanged for anything else. Now let’s have a look at the startOAuth() method. try { httpOauthConsumer = new CommonsHttpOAuthConsumer(consumerKey, consumerSecret); httpOauthprovider = new DefaultOAuthProvider(&#34;http://twitter.com/oauth/request_token&#34;, &#34;http://twitter.com/oauth/access_token&#34;, &#34;http://twitter.com/oauth/authorize&#34;); String authUrl = httpOauthprovider.retrieveRequestToken(httpOauthConsumer, CALLBACKURL); // Open the browser startActivity(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW, Uri.parse(authUrl))); } catch (Exception e) { Toast.makeText(this, e.getMessage(), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show(); } Here we create the necessary OAuth objects which will in turn generate the unique authenticating URL. Once we have the URL we open the browser and point it to that URL. The user will be presented with a dialog asking them to allow or to deny your application access. In order for our activity to be able to receive the callback, we need to add a few things the Android manifest file. Change the applications definition to the following: &lt;activity android:name=&#34;Main&#34; android:launchMode=&#34;singleInstance&#34;&gt; &lt;intent-filter&gt; &lt;action android:name=&#34;android.intent.action.VIEW&#34; /&gt; &lt;category android:name=&#34;android.intent.category.DEFAULT&#34; /&gt; &lt;category android:name=&#34;android.intent.category.BROWSABLE&#34; /&gt; &lt;data android:scheme=&#34;app&#34; android:host=&#34;twitter&#34; /&gt; &lt;/intent-filter&gt; &lt;/activity&gt; Note that if you changed the app and twitter in the CALLBACK variable above, you will need to make sure that the change is reflected here. This basically allows the activity to receive data from a foreign source - our browser. Now we need to catch the callback and handle it. We do that by overriding the onNewIntent() method of our Main activity. @Override protected void onNewIntent(Intent intent) { super.onNewIntent(intent); Uri uri = intent.getData(); //Check if you got NewIntent event due to Twitter Call back only if (uri != null &amp;&amp; uri.toString().startsWith(CALLBACKURL)) { String verifier = uri.getQueryParameter(oauth.signpost.OAuth.OAUTH_VERIFIER); try { // this will populate token and token_secret in consumer httpOauthprovider.retrieveAccessToken(httpOauthConsumer, verifier); String userKey = httpOauthConsumer.getToken(); String userSecret = httpOauthConsumer.getTokenSecret(); // Save user_key and user_secret in user preferences and return SharedPreferences settings = getBaseContext().getSharedPreferences(&#34;your_app_prefs&#34;, 0); SharedPreferences.Editor editor = settings.edit(); editor.putString(&#34;user_key&#34;, userKey); editor.putString(&#34;user_secret&#34;, userSecret); editor.commit(); } catch(Exception e){ } } else { // Do something if the callback comes from elsewhere } } OK, there’s quite a bit there. We extract the data that the browser sent back to us. This data is used to verify that the authentication was successful and that we can now access the user’s data. From the data, we get the user’s key and their secret. We save that into the application’s shared preferences file and return. Now we are good to go. We can make authenticated requests to Twitter API on behalf of the user. For example, to get the user’s home timeline, you would do something like: HttpGet get = new HttpGet(&#34;http://api.twitter.com/version/statuses/home_timeline.json&#34;); HttpParams params = new BasicHttpParams(); HttpProtocolParams.setUseExpectContinue(params, false); get.setParams(params); // sign the request to authenticate httpOauthConsumer.sign(get); String responsex = mClient.execute(get, new BasicResponseHandler()); JSONArray array = new JSONArray(responsex); And the array variable is a list of the latest tweets in the user’s home timeline.

            <title>Posterous-style Blogging On App Engine</title>

            <content type="html">
              Posterous-style Blogging On App Engine Posterous has been getting a lot of attention lately. Its simplicity appeals to a wide range of users and more and more users are switching over from other well-established blogging platforms such as Blogger or WordPress. In this article, we will have a look at how you can replicate the Posterous functionality on App Engine. In case you don’t know what Posterous is, it’s very simple. It’s a blogging tool like Google’s Bloggeror Wordpress.com. What makes it different from the other services is its ridiculous simplicity. With Posterous, you don’t need to create an account. That’s because you create new posts by emailing your post to Posterous. It creates links for you, images sent as attachments will be transformed into galleries, etc. I like Posterous, but my website has a lot of custom programming on the back-end so I’m very hesitant to switch over. And besides, I like to know how things work behind the scenes. I thought it might be fun to create a system similar to Posterous’ for my own blog which is, of course, hosted on App Engine. Here is what we are going to do. I want to be able to send an email to my own blog and have it turn it into a post and publish it to the blog. OK, let’s start with the post model: class Post(db.Model): title = db.StringProperty() body = db.TextProperty() added = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True) author = db.StringProperty() Very straight forward. You have your title, body, author and when the post was published. In order to enable incoming email, you need to add a couple of lines of code to your app.yaml file. In addition to your regular handlers, add the following: inbound_services: - mail handlers: - url: /_ah/mail/.+ script: main.py The first line enables incoming email for your application. The second part is the important part. On App Engine, an incoming email message is processed as a HTTP POST request. Since it’s a regular HTTP request, we will need a handler for it in the app.yaml file. You have several options here. You can create a catch-all handler for all incoming email addresses (like I’ve done above), or create seperate handlers for different addresses. The email address that we will use is in the following format: your_string@appid.appspotmail.com. You should substitute the appid with your app’s ID. The string before the ‘@’ symbol can be set to anything you want. With this out of the way, we are ready to write the actual email handler. This will go into your main.py file which you defined in the app.yaml. First, some imports: import email from google.appengine.ext.webapp.mail_handlers import InboundMailHandler Then, you add the following to the list of URL mappings in the instantiation of the application class. application = webapp.WSGIApplication([ (&#39;/&#39;, Index), EmailHandler.mapping() ], debug=True) Here EmailHandler is the request handler class that will handle the incoming email. The mapping() method will map all of the addresses and send all of them to this handler class. It’s just a convenience method, no magic here. Now, finally, onto the actual handler: class EmailHandler(InboundMailHandler): def receive(self, mail_message): post = Post() post.title = mail_message.subject for content_type, body in mail_message.bodies(): post.body = body.decode() post.author = &#39;John Smith&#39; post.put() This is actually very simple. The incoming email message is saved in the mail_message variable and you can access all of the usual email metadata as its properties (e.g. mail_message.sender). So, we create a new post, take the email’s subject and set it as the post’s title. The bodies() method extracts the body of the email and the decode() function will decode the actual body. Then we set the author and save the post in the datastore. Often you will want to include a link in your post, or create a list. This is easily accomplished with HTML tags. However, HTML tags are a pain, so you might want to use something like Markdown. Adding markdown support is super easy. Download the Python Markdown library and put the markdown2.py file in your app’s root directory. Then import it in your main.py file. import markdown2 And change the following line: post.body = body.decode() to this: post.body = markdown2.markdown(body.decode()) And that’s it! Conclusion This is a very simple yet effective technique and it will allow you to create post from anywhere. I hope you’ve enjoyed the post. Let me know if you have any suggestions on how to improve it. Code The complete code for this app is available on Github.

            <content type="html">
              Twitter Success Story - Hurricane Bill Beginners often find Twitter very confusing and useless. I think it’s because they come to it with some preconceived ideas, and when Twitter doesn’t fit their model they get frustrated. This series is meant to show why Twitter is so useful and how it’s different from other social networks. My family and I live in the city of Aberdeen in Scotland. My wife is originally from Halifax, Canada where her parents still live. In August of last year, there was a hurricane threat to the Halifax area. The hurricane was slowly making its way up the coast towards Halifax, and was to strike the city around 8:00AM on a Sunday morning. Naturally, we were in touch with my in-laws and kept checking news sites for updates. However, as you might expect the news companies were closed (or at least on limited staff) on that Sunday morning. We googled and googled and couldn’t find any updates on the hurricane. Did it hit the city? Is it serious? Has electricity been cut off? Twitter is a source of real-time information. With the right query, you can get updates and news just about anything. So, I searched for “hurricane bill halifax” and just watched the tweets come in. At first, there wasn’t much. But as time went by, people started talking about the hurricane. Some were saying that the sky is a bit darker, some were seeing a little rain, etc. I even found one user who actually went to the Halifax harbour to watch the hurricane come in. He was posting images from his cell phone to show us what the weather was like. Thanks to Twitter we were able to follow the development of the hurricane almost minute by minute. In the end, there wasn’t much of hurricane after all. By the time it got to Halifax, it had reduced to a mere storm.
