<h3>Gender inclusive&nbsp;language</h3>
<p>In a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bedfordbaptist.ca/services/156">recent sermon</a> at our church, a pastor student said to us that we are no
longer able to say that Jesus will make his disciples <em>&#xFB01;shers of men</em>. Rather,
she suggested, we should use the politically correct phrase <em>&#xFB01;shers of
people</em>.</p>
<p>There is always talk of gender-inclusive language when it comes to Bible
translation.  But this one seems a little too far.  Or it doesn&#8217;t feel&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>As I have been thing of this, I came across other things we say that that are
sexist in this way that don&#8217;t seem to bother&nbsp;anyone.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Watch any detective show and without fail, the perpetrator or killer will
be called <em>he</em> and <em>him</em>.  Women never&nbsp;kill.</li>
<li>Within the committees of our church, we longer say <em>chairman</em> but
<em>chairperson</em>.  If we were to follow that same logic, we should refer to
<em>snowmen</em> as <em>snowpeople</em>.</li>
<li>The other day, my family visited my mother-in-law while she was selling her
home <span class="amp">&amp;</span> gift products at an event.  At one point, she said &#8220;&#8230; I can&#8217;t I&#8217;m
manning my table.&#8221;  Was she really?  Shouldn&#8217;t she have said <em>womanning</em>?</li>
</ol>
<p>A little&nbsp;absurd.</p>

<h3>Mutt sidebar&nbsp;labels</h3>
<p>The sidebar in Mutt is useful if you have multiple email accounts and want to
switch between them quickly.  It shows you each inbox with a number of unread
emails.  I have 6 Gmail accounts plugged into my Mutt and here is what I used
to&nbsp;see.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
INBOX (1)
INBOX
INBOX (2)
INBOX (1)
INBOX (7)
INBOX
</pre>
<p>And I had to remember which one was which.  Let&#8217;s say you have your mailboxes
in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.mail</span></tt>.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ls ~/.mail
work home
</pre>
<p>Create a directory called <tt class="docutils literal">aliases</tt> and symlink the inboxes to that&nbsp;directory:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ln -s ~/.mail/work/INBOX ~/.mail/alias/work
$ ln -s ~/.mail/home/INBOX ~/.mail/alias/home
</pre>
<p>Then, point your Mutt sidebar con&#xFB01;g at those.  When you open Mutt the next
time, it should look like&nbsp;this</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
work (1)
home (8)
</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s much more useful than just a list of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="caps">INBOX</span></tt> things.</p>

<h3>Haskell&nbsp;Strings</h3>
<p>It continues to amaze me how bad Haskell is at processing strings.  One of the
reasons I wanted to learn Haskell was to be able to write short,
dynamic-language-like programs that execute fast once compiled.  Somehow
rather, Haskell has failed to deliver on its promise of <em>bare metal</em> speed.  I
mostly write scripts and utilities meant to run on my machine&#8212;these scripts
mostly process text.  Read a &#xFB01;le, parse it and spit something&nbsp;out.</p>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s build a simple program that will show what I&#8217;m talking&nbsp;about.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Read a &#xFB01;le called <tt class="docutils literal">&#xFB01;le</tt> which contains&nbsp;prose</li>
<li>Capitalize every word in that body of&nbsp;text</li>
<li>Print the result to&nbsp;stdout</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be testing our programs with a &#xFB01;le with about 1.2 million lines of
Lorem Ipsum.  This &#xFB01;le is around&nbsp;<span class="caps">75MB</span>.</p>
<p>Here is attemp number one.  This is really simple&nbsp;Haskell.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">-- Normal.hs</span>

<span class="kr">module</span> <span class="nn">Main</span> <span class="kr">where</span>

    <span class="n">putStr</span> <span class="o">$</span> <span class="n">convert</span> <span class="n">name</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Compile and execute&nbsp;with</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ghc -O2 -o normal Normal.hs
time ./normal &gt; /dev/null
</pre>
<p>This takes about 17 seconds.  Let&#8217;s see if we can do any better.  When you
complain about Strings in Haskell being slow on some neckbeard forum, people
will tell you to use <tt class="docutils literal">Data.Text</tt>.</p>

</pre></div>
<p>This is mostly the same as above.  Instead of using the <tt class="docutils literal">String</tt> type to work
with text, we use the <tt class="docutils literal">Data.Text.Text</tt> type.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
ghc -O2 -o main Main.hs
time ./main &gt; /dev/null
</pre>
<p>How did it do?  One entire minute, that&#8217;s 5 times slower.  And it uses obscene
amounts of memory (around <span class="caps">600MB</span> on my machine).  Let&#8217;s use lazy <span class="caps">IO</span> when reading
the &#xFB01;le, maybe it will&nbsp;improve.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">-- change this</span>
<span class="kr">import</span> <span class="k">quali&#xFB01;ed</span> <span class="nn">Data.Text</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">T</span>
<span class="kr">import</span> <span class="k">quali&#xFB01;ed</span> <span class="nn">Data.Text.<span class="caps">IO</span></span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">X</span>

<span class="c1">-- to this</span>
<span class="kr">import</span> <span class="k">quali&#xFB01;ed</span> <span class="nn">Data.Text.Lazy</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">T</span>

</pre></div>
<p>This clocks in at 27 seconds.  Much better than the non-lazy version.  Next
thing to try is to ignore unicode and go for the ultimate, bare-metal speed.
Let&#8217;s use <tt class="docutils literal">ByteString</tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal">Text</tt>.</p>

<p>Hm, not that much better.  27 seconds.  That&#8217;s about as good as the lazy
version when using <tt class="docutils literal">Text</tt>.  Let&#8217;s see if we can squeeze more perfomance out
of this with a lazy <tt class="docutils literal">ByteString</tt></p>

<p>This takes about 10 seconds.  Awesome.  This is the best I can do with Haskell.
10 seconds to process 1.2 million lines of text.  I guess that&#8217;s not too&nbsp;bad.</p>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="on-learning-clojure">
<h3>On Learning&nbsp;Clojure</h3>
<div class="section" id="pre&#xFB01;x-notation">
<h4>Pre&#xFB01;x&nbsp;notation</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of the pre&#xFB01;x notation.  It makes everything appear the same
(if-statements, function calls , etc).  I like how it removes the need for
operator precedence&nbsp;rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="all-the-parentheses">
<h4>All the&nbsp;parentheses</h4>
<p>Once you get into learning Clojure and you have written a small application,
you don&#8217;t really see the parens anymore.  Sure, sometimes you still get the
<em>Unbalanced parens</em> error but those are easy to spot.  If you are afraid of
learning a <span class="caps">LISP</span> because of this, don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll be&nbsp;&#xFB01;ne.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jvm">
<h4><span class="caps">JVM</span></h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say that the start-up time of the <span class="caps">JVM</span> isn&#8217;t the fastest.  This makes
Clojure effectively useless for writing utility scripts.  However, the <span class="caps">JVM</span> is a
robust platform that runs your code really fast.  With Clojure, you get all the
bene&#xFB01;ts of the <span class="caps">JVM</span>: garbage collection, <span class="caps">JIT</span>, uberjars, etc.  Using Java
libraries in Clojure is usually pretty straightforward if you know the basics
of Java (but the code isn&#8217;t the prettiest).  This is great because some of the
lower level stuff doesn&#8217;t have to be reimplemented (think <span class="caps">SHA1</span> digests,
sockets,&nbsp;etc).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h4>Documentation</h4>
<p>The language itself seems to be documented pretty well.  I haven&#8217;t had any
issues when trying to &#xFB01;nd the signature for a built-in function.  However, the
community isn&#8217;t exactly known for writing documentation.  Most of the time, you
&#xFB01;nd a library on Github and you are left to read the source.  If you are
lucky, you are told what to import and a few basic examples.  Good
documentation is something I take for granted coming from the Python&nbsp;world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="libraries">
<h4>Libraries</h4>
<p>While you can certainly &#xFB01;nd a lot of good libraries for doing common things,
one area is still painful to develop for: the web.  Clojure still needs a
Django-like web framework that has all the batteries included.  Right now, the
only popular web framework is Noir and it&#8217;s more like Sinatra or Flask.
Without a Django-like platform, you end up reinventing all the common things
for every application: authentication, form validation, <span class="caps">ORM</span>,&nbsp;etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>I really like the language.  I like the functional aspects of it and the
immutability.  I like lazy sequences and refs.  What I don&#8217;t like is that the
community and the ecosystem is still a bit young and immature.  I &#xFB01;nd myself
waiting for stuff to happen before I can use this language&nbsp;more.</p>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="large-javascript-application-tips">
<h3>Large Javascript Application&nbsp;Tips</h3>
<p>This post isn&#8217;t going to tell you that you should use <span class="caps">MVC</span> to structure your
application.  It isn&#8217;t going to tell you which framework to use.  It&#8217;s not
going to tell you to use CoffeeScript or MongoDB.  But I&#8217;m going to talk about
some small helpful things you can do to your Javascript application to make
easier to develop and&nbsp;maintain.</p>
<div class="section" id="naming-conventions">
<h4>Naming&nbsp;Conventions</h4>
<p>Improperly naming your variables, functions and classes can make it nearly
impossible to navigate large portions of existing code.  You have to follow the
chain all the way up where that variable was created (sometimes in a different
&#xFB01;le) to see what type of value it holds.  By looking at a variable name, you
should be able to tell if it&#8217;s a class de&#xFB01;nition or an instance.  You should
be able to distinguish between a constant and a&nbsp;function.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="&#xFB01;le-dependency">
<h4>File&nbsp;dependency</h4>
<p>Writing large Javascript applications for the browser is tricky because your
application needs to be split over multiple &#xFB01;les and there doesn&#8217;t seem to be
a good way to manage dependencies.  When you open up a &#xFB01;le in your project,
you can&#8217;t really know what Javascript code was loaded and executed before this
&#xFB01;le.  Often times you &#xFB01;nd yourself looking at your build script or the
<tt class="docutils literal">head</tt> of your <span class="caps">HTML</span> document to see when this &#xFB01;le is loaded in the grand
scheme of things.  In Python, you say <tt class="docutils literal">from app import get_user</tt> to use a
function from a different &#xFB01;le or module.  In the browser, you just don&#8217;t.  I
&#xFB01;nd it useful to specify these kinds of dependencies at the top of each &#xFB01;le
within a simple&nbsp;comment.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// maps.js</span>
<span class="c1">//</span>
<span class="c1">// This &#xFB01;le provides the ``Maps`` namespace.</span>
<span class="c1">// It depends on jQuery and jquery.cookie.js.</span>
<span class="c1">// It depends on the ``userId`` variable from the document.</span>
<span class="c1">//</span>
<span class="c1">// (function($) {</span>
<span class="c1">//   ...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="class-de&#xFB01;nition-time-and-consumption-time">
<h4>Class de&#xFB01;nition time and consumption&nbsp;time</h4>
<p>There should be a clear distinction between when your classes are de&#xFB01;ned and
when they are consumed.  I like to prepare all my classes and functions
beforehand, and then kick off the app with a single call when the document is
ready.  It&#8217;s nice to be able to tell that this is where the app&nbsp;starts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="namespaces">
<h4>Namespaces</h4>
<p>Your entire application should be contained within a namespace.  Putting all of
your code under a namespace makes it easy to tell where what function or class
de&#xFB01;nition is coming from.  It makes sure that you don&#8217;t pollute the global
namespace.  It also allows you to select which functions and variables are
going to be exposed&nbsp;publicly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h4>Documentation</h4>
<p>If your application isn&#8217;t going to be open-source, you might be tempted to skip
writing documentation.  Adding a few comments here and there in the code can
help you quickly understand what is going on and where related code might live.
This also helps a lot when on-boarding new developers.  When a new member of
your team opens up an 800-line-of-code &#xFB01;le with zero comments, they might
crawl under their desk and cry (I&#8217;ve wanted to do that a few times&nbsp;before).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="frameworks">
<h4>Frameworks</h4>
<p>If you do decide to use a framework like Backbone.js, you should make sure that
you use it in a sane way.  When a new member joins your team, it&#8217;s really nice
when you can point them to the framework&#8217;s documentation and have them start
learning.  Obviously, you will want to do some custom things and maybe even
build extensions to the framework and that&#8217;s &#xFB01;ne as long as it&#8217;s documented
and&nbsp;obvious.</p>

<h3>Why you should use Heroku for your next&nbsp;start-up</h3>
<p>You are a ninja-rockstar developer with a billion dollar idea.  You write Ruby
and Javascript.  You like <span class="caps">BDD</span>, responsive design, <span class="caps">HTML5</span> and node.js.  You are
really good at <span class="caps">UX</span> and quickly producing a prototype.  You have been working on
your app for a few&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to deploy your&nbsp;app.</p>
<p>Because you are a hot new start-up, you will of course use <span class="caps">AWS</span>.  You spend a
few hours trying to &#xFB01;gure out how many of which instance type you will need.
You decide you need a load balancer, a bunch of app servers, a database server
and a worker server.  That should about cover you.  Next up is Chef.  You spend
a few days learning about provisioning a new <span class="caps">VM</span> with Chef.  You are so excited
about how you can automatically provision a new app server when your start-up
hits the front page of TechCrunch.  You spend a week con&#xFB01;guring and testing
your Chef scripts.  And then the big day comes.  You deploy your application.
Everything works the &#xFB01;rst time and you are overjoyed.  First users start to
appear and your architecture performs really well.  You hit the front page of
HackerNews and get tens of thousands of hits on your site.  You &#xFB01;nd a small
bug in your cache invalidation logic which you &#xFB01;x really quickly.  You deploy
your &#xFB01;x and what do you know?  That script that installs your project&#8217;s
dependencies when you deploy just pulled in a new version of a library that
deploys your static &#xFB01;les to S3.  And of course that new version contains
backwards incompatible changes and completely breaks your app.  You are
frantically trying to &#xFB01;gure out what happened.  You think, <span class="caps">OK</span>, I will put up a
maintenance page while I sort this out.  You try to <span class="caps">SSH</span> into your load balancer
and try to change the routing settings.  What a mess.  What do you do when your
database starts swapping? What happens when your Redis server runs out of
memory and dies?  You barely understand how to install MySQL, let alone how to
get the most out of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Enter&nbsp;Heroku.</p>
<p>Single command deployments.  Fully-managed database service.  Automatic
load-balancing.  On-demand scaling.  No manual <span class="caps">SSH</span> to see what&#8217;s&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>A request comes in, the load balancer picks it up and sends it to a suitable
app server instance.  The app server instance talks to a highly optimized
database instance.  Redis is sitting on a super beefy machine with lots of <span class="caps">RAM</span>
and you never have to worry about it.  When you are ready to make a deployment,
the load balancer bounces each app server in turn to make sure you don&#8217;t lose
any requests.  All you need to do is <tt class="docutils literal">git push heroku master</tt>.</p>
<p>Sure, Heroku is a bit more expensive than <span class="caps">EC2</span>.  But when you think of how many
smart people are taking care of your app, it&#8217;s really cheap.  It&#8217;s like having
your own sys&nbsp;admin.</p>
<p>You need&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I&#8217;m in no way connected to Heroku.  This posts is an attempt to
convince myself that I shouldn&#8217;t be using Chef for my
side-project-start-up-ideas.  And I&#8217;m not a Ruby&nbsp;guy.</p>

            <id>http://honza.ca/2012/05/how-i-use-git</id>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="how-i-use-git">
<h3>How I use&nbsp;git</h3>
<p>Recently, I have noticed that there are quite a few wrappers around git to give
you a nicer interface to work with.  The new commands promise to be easy to
remember and make your life less frustrating.  I &#xFB01;nd these a little silly
because git on its own is a great tool.  Here I&#8217;m going to describe how I use
git to convince you (and myself) that it&#8217;s not that&nbsp;hard.</p>
<div class="section" id="cloning">
<h4>Cloning</h4>
<p>This couldn&#8217;t be any&nbsp;simpler:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git clone git://github.com/honza/dot&#xFB01;les.git
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="committing">
<h4>Committing</h4>
<p>Once I have cloned a repo, I start to make changes.  To see what &#xFB01;les I have
changed, I&nbsp;run</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git status
</pre>
<p>Or to see what actual changes I&nbsp;made</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git diff
</pre>
<p>Then, when I&#8217;m ready to commit, I stage the &#xFB01;les.  The index is one of my
favorite features of git.  It lets me decide what changes I want to commit.
Maybe I correct something as I work on something else.  Those things aren&#8217;t
related so they shouldn&#8217;t go into the same commit.  I grew up on Mercurial and
not having the index in Mercurial now really bothers&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>To stage all changed &#xFB01;les, I&nbsp;do</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git add -u
</pre>
<p>If I decide that the changes I made are stupid and I want to get rid of them, I&nbsp;do</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git checkout .
</pre>
<p>To make sure all staged changes are the right&nbsp;ones</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git diff --cached
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stashing">
<h4>Stashing</h4>
<p>I often stash my code.  Sometimes you need to look at some code in a different
branch, sometimes I notice something is broken and I want to see if I broke it
or&nbsp;not.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git stash
</pre>
<p>will stash your changes.  To get it back I&nbsp;do</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git stash pop
</pre>
<p>And also, often I will see what I had&nbsp;stashed</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git stash list
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="branches">
<h4>Branches</h4>
<p>Creating new branches is simple and&nbsp;cheap</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git checkout -b new_branch
</pre>
<p>Delete a&nbsp;branch</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git branch -d branch_name
</pre>
<p>Or delete a branch on a remote&nbsp;server</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git push origin :branch_name
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rebasing">
<h4>Rebasing</h4>
<p>I have <a class="reference external" href="http://honza.ca/2011/05/the-importance-of-git-rebase">written</a> on
rebasing before.  It makes your history much nicer.  Any time I pull code from
a remote repository, I&nbsp;do</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git pull --rebase
</pre>
<p>Or, if it&#8217;s a speci&#xFB01;c&nbsp;branch</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git pull --rebase origin dev
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bisecting">
<h4>Bisecting</h4>
<p>I <em>love</em> the bisect commnad in git.  You can use it to determine which commit
introduced a bug.  This is especially useful if you have a comprehensive test
suite.  For example, the latest commit is broken and you remember that all
tests where passing in version 1.2.  This example uses&nbsp;Django.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git bisect start HEAD v1.2 --      # HEAD is bad, v1.2 is good
git bisect run python manage.py test
</pre>
<p>Git will then keep running your tests until it &#xFB01;nds the &#xFB01;rst commit that&#8217;s&nbsp;broken.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="merging">
<h4>Merging</h4>
<p>When a feature branch is &#xFB01;nished, I merge it into master&nbsp;with</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff feature
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="viewing-history">
<h4>Viewing&nbsp;history</h4>
<p>For viewing history, I really like the following&nbsp;command</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git log --pretty=format:&quot;%h - %an, %ar : %s&quot;'
</pre>
<p>This gives you the commit <span class="caps">SHA</span>, then the author&#8217;s name, how long ago it was made
and a brief, one-line summary of the changes.  I have it aliased as <tt class="docutils literal">gitl</tt>.
I also use a simple graph to see the relationships between&nbsp;branches</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git log --oneline --graph
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="upgrading-all-submodules-in-a-project">
<h4>Upgrading all submodules in a&nbsp;project</h4>
<p>This one is great, too.  I use it to upgrade all of my vim&nbsp;plugins.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git submodule foreach git pull
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pulling-and-pushing">
<h4>Pulling and&nbsp;pushing</h4>
<p>This is pretty straight&nbsp;forward</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
git pull
git pull origin dev

git push
git push origin dev
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Once you learn what git calls what, it&#8217;s pretty easy to just google the thing
you&#8217;re trying to do.  I&#8217;m de&#xFB01;nitely not an expert but this gets me&nbsp;by.</p>

            <id>http://honza.ca/2012/04/standing-desk-first-impressions</id>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="standing-desk-&#xFB01;rst-impressions">
<h3>Standing desk - &#xFB01;rst&nbsp;impressions</h3>
<p>I have recently switched jobs and had to set up a home of&#xFB01;ce.  I have heard a
lot of good things about standing desks and thought this was the perfect
opportunity to try one.  I had looked for one online but those things aren&#8217;t
cheap (~&nbsp;$800).</p>
<p>Instead of dropping some serious cash, I stacked up some bins and made a
poorman&#8217;s standing desk.  I have a laptop stand and a second monitor.  Nothing
special,&nbsp;really.</p>
<p>I have been standing while programming for over a week now and I wanted to
share a few thoughts.  If you&#8217;re wondering if you should get a standing desk,
I&#8217;d de&#xFB01;nitely recommend&nbsp;it.</p>
<div class="section" id="incentives">
<h4>Incentives</h4>
<p>I have set up my desk in such a way that if I want to sit down to do some work
I have to give up the second monitor and my Das keyboard.  I use a 13&#8221; Macbook
Pro so the number of pixels is rather limited.  I <em>love</em> my loud Das keyboard
and want to use it as much as possible.  This works extremely&nbsp;well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="breaks">
<h4>Breaks</h4>
<p>When I take a break to have lunch with my family (or something like that), I
make it a point to sit down and rest my feet.  When I get back in the of&#xFB01;ce, I
don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m gonna&nbsp;die.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="distractions">
<h4>Distractions</h4>
<p>I have found that when I&#8217;m standing I rarely check Hacker News or read
articles.  I think it&#8217;s because reading an article or two isn&#8217;t complex enough
for my brain and it can do other things at the same time&#8212;like think about how
much my feet hurt.  I &#xFB01;nd that when I&#8217;m standing I get a lot more done because
I can focus a lot more.  Near the end of the day when I&#8217;m tired and actually do
sit down to work, I feel like I&#8217;m walking under water.  Since I&#8217;m just getting
started I have allowed myself some slack here and there.  I don&#8217;t want to go
too fast and <em>burn out</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dancing">
<h4>Dancing</h4>
<p>I have heard that people like to dance when they&#8217;re standing at their desk.  I
always thought this was pretty silly until I caught myself doing it.  I listen
to a lot of rock n roll so it&#8217;s not exactly&nbsp;surprising.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pain">
<h4>Pain</h4>
<p>Obviously, your feet will hurt.  However, it&#8217;s not nearly as bad as I thought.
I&#8217;m 23 and fairly &#xFB01;t so maybe that&#8217;s a factor.  I have had some minor lower
back pain which I think is caused by the fact that I now have good posture and
the body isn&#8217;t used to&nbsp;it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Do you stand while working?  Ever thought about getting a standing&nbsp;desk?</p>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="how-rackspace-deleted-my-server">
<h3>How Rackspace deleted my&nbsp;server</h3>
<p>I have been with Rackspace for a while now and never had problems.  The server
has been fast and responsive and their prices are great.  However, what
happened yesterday blew my mind and totally made me change how I view server
providers as a whole&#8212;including the likes of <span class="caps">AWS</span> and&nbsp;Heroku.</p>
<p>Here is how it went&nbsp;down.</p>
<div class="section" id="pm-cst">
<h4>2:07pm&nbsp;<span class="caps">CST</span></h4>
<p>I got an email from one of my administrators that the front end was
unreachable.  I immediately tried to visit the web application in my browser,
log into the machine via <span class="caps">SSH</span> and ping the server <span class="caps">IP</span> address.  All failed.  I
went on the Rackspace Cloud Server Live Chat to raise the issue with&nbsp;them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h4>2:48pm&nbsp;<span class="caps">CST</span></h4>
<p>I was told to open a ticket through the admin console.  So I did and I handed
the ticket number to the operator who said they&#8217;d pass it on to&nbsp;operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h4>5:05pm&nbsp;<span class="caps">CST</span></h4>
<p>I got a reply on the ticket.  All it says is <em>we&#8217;re working on it</em>.  At this
point, I&#8217;m freaking out because I have been down for over three&nbsp;hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id3">
<h4>6:00pm&nbsp;<span class="caps">CST</span></h4>
<p>Still no word from Rackspace.  I got on the phone and explained the issue and
that I didn&#8217;t feel it was being taken seriously.  The operator got the account
manager on the phone who in turn got a <em>tech guy</em> on the call.  They said that
the <span class="caps">VM</span> wasn&#8217;t built properly when I &#xFB01;rst created it like 6 months ago and that
at that time it was queued up to be deleted and rebuilt.  It took this long to
&#xFB01;nally come down the queue and actually get deleted.  They said they would
rebuild the server and let me keep the same <span class="caps">IP</span> and that I would get an email
with new&nbsp;credentials.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id4">
<h4>6:17pm&nbsp;<span class="caps">CST</span></h4>
<p>I received said email and started to restore the server.  Luckily, I had a
working Chef script which made this very simple to do.  I think I was back
online in about 30&nbsp;minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Everyone has been really nice and apologetic.  They even gave me a month&#8217;s
credit to cover the damages.  I still think Rackspace is great but this whole
incident made me realize that anything can fail and that you should design your
application for easy recovery.  And test your&nbsp;backups!</p>

                <div class="section" id="remap-capslock-to-something-useful">
<h3>Remap CapsLock to something&nbsp;useful</h3>
<p>Arguably, CapsLock is <a class="reference external" href="http://capsoff.org/">the most useless key</a> on your keyboard. I honestly
can&#8217;t remember the last time I had a real use for it. If are a programmer, you
should remap it to something more useful. The rest of this post will describe
how to remap your CapsLock on a Mac <span class="caps">OSX</span>&nbsp;installation.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-are-going-to-do">
<h4>What we are going to&nbsp;do</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m a heavy vim user and reaching for the Esc key all the is a pain. We will
remap the CapsLock to Esc. However, I want to be able to use it for something
else if I&#8217;m not in vim. We will set it up so that when you hit CapsLock on its
own, it will send Esc. However, if you hold CapsLock and press another key, it
will send Ctrl. That way you can do things like Ctrl+F,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>On Mac <span class="caps">OSX</span>, you will want to do use <a class="reference external" href="http://pqrs.org/macosx/keyremap4macbook/">KeyRemap4MacBook</a>. It&#8217;s an excellent
piece of software that will allow you to take control of your&nbsp;keyboard.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="settings">
<h4>Settings</h4>
<p>Once you have installed KeyRemap4MacBook, go to System Preferences and select
the Keyboard submenu. Hit the Modi&#xFB01;er Keys button and remap CapsLock to Ctrl.
You will have to do this once for every keyboard that you&nbsp;use.</p>
<p>Next, head over to the KeyRemap4MacBook settings. The magical setting you are
looking for&nbsp;is</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Control_L to Control_L
    (+ When you type Control_L only, send Escape)
</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s&nbsp;it!</p>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="how-not-to-depend-on-pypi">
<h3>How not to depend on&nbsp;PyPI</h3>
<p>When deploying a Django application, you often use a <tt class="docutils literal">requirements.txt</tt> &#xFB01;le
that contains a list of the application&#8217;s dependencies. During deployment, your
provisioning system will <tt class="docutils literal">pip install</tt> all of those to make sure that your
application runs as&nbsp;desired.</p>
<p>The format of a typical <tt class="docutils literal">requirements.txt</tt> &#xFB01;les isn&#8217;t unlike the&nbsp;following</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
django==1.3.1
psycopg2==2.4.4
Fabric==1.3.3
...
</pre>
<p>By default, <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt> will go to the <a class="reference external" href="http://pypi.python.org">Python Package Index</a> (PyPI) and look for
that package&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, PyPI has been known to be down or slow at times; and you want
your deployments to be as smooth as&nbsp;possible.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-you-can-do">
<h4>What you can&nbsp;do</h4>
<p>Instead of depending on PyPI for a production application, you can host the
packages that your application needs yourself. It&#8217;s actually surpringly easy to
do. Your existing deployment strategy can easily be modi&#xFB01;ed to remove the&nbsp;dependency.</p>
<p>First, we will create a freeze of your requirements. This will look into your
environment and &#xFB01;gure out which version of which package you will need for the
production&nbsp;environment.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ pip freeze -r requirements.txt &gt; freeze.txt
</pre>
<p>Once you have the list of packages, you can tell <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt> to download all the
packages into a directory without installing&nbsp;them.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ pip install -d pypi -r freeze.txt
</pre>
<p>This will download all packages from <tt class="docutils literal">freeze.txt</tt> into the <tt class="docutils literal">pypi/</tt>
directory.</p>
<p>The next step is to upload all these packages to a publicly accessible server
that can serve static &#xFB01;les. This can anything from S3, Cloud&#xFB01;les or even
Github pages. I like to place all of these packages into a <tt class="docutils literal">packages/</tt>
directory. You will also need a simple index &#xFB01;le to go with your packages. All
the index &#xFB01;le needs to is provide a list of <span class="caps">HTML</span> links to those packages. The
index will be used by <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt> to locate the package source&nbsp;distribution.</p>
<p>I have put together a simple Fabric task that will read the contents of the
<tt class="docutils literal">pypi/</tt> directory and create this index &#xFB01;le for&nbsp;you.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">make_index</span><span class="p">():</span>

                <div class="section" id="disrupt-the-multiple-gmail-space">
<h3>Disrupt the multiple-gmail&nbsp;space</h3>
<p>We all know that Gmail is the best email provider out there. It&#8217;s in the
browser, it&#8217;s all ajaxy, you never delete anything, your emails are
cleverly organized into conversations, you know the&nbsp;drill&#8230;</p>
<p>But have you ever tried to use more than one account at a time? It&#8217;s horribly
broken. Let&#8217;s have a look at your&nbsp;options&#8230;</p>
<div class="section" id="multiple-sign-in">
<h4>Multiple&nbsp;sign-in</h4>
<p>Google allows you to log into more than one account at a time. They provide you
with a menu option to switch between the two and you are all set. The problem
is that the constant switching back and forth just isn&#8217;t worth&nbsp;it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-a-desktop-client">
<h4>Use a desktop&nbsp;client</h4>
<p>If you use a desktop client like Thunderbird or Mail.app, you can have as many
accounts as you want. But you don&#8217;t get access to your contacts and rarely get
the nice conversation view for your messages. In addition, the applications are
often bloated and use a ton of&nbsp;memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-mutt-or-pino">
<h4>Use mutt or&nbsp;pino</h4>
<p>These light-weight applications are popular especially among programmers. They
are a pain to setup and lack email address&nbsp;autocompletion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-multiple-browsers">
<h4>Use multiple&nbsp;browsers</h4>
<p>If you have one or two Gmail accounts, you could probably get away with using
two browsers - one for each account. This is silly and you shouldn&#8217;t do&nbsp;that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-chrome-pro&#xFB01;les">
<h4>Use Chrome&nbsp;pro&#xFB01;les</h4>
<p>Newer versions of Chome will allow you to be logged into different Gmail
accounts in different windows. This means that each window is logged into a
single Google account and can only access the services associated with that
account. This is &#xFB01;ne for two accounts, but if you have 4+ it can get
ridiculous pretty&nbsp;fast.</p>
<p>None of these options give you a good solution for a uni&#xFB01;ed inbox. They all
have their&nbsp;shortcomings.</p>
<p>There is a huge opportunity to disrupt this space as they are a lot of us who
have to use a lot of different Gmail&nbsp;accounts.</p>
<p>I have been using Mozilla Thunderbird with two add-ons: Google contacts and
Google Conversations. They are rather close to doing the right thing but it&#8217;s
still missing something. I tried to set up mutt but it wasn&#8217;t working for me
because of the missing&nbsp;autocomplete.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="your-say">
<h4>Your&nbsp;say</h4>
<p>What do you use? How do you deal with this&nbsp;mess?</p>

            <id>http://honza.ca/2012/01/upgrading-your-django-media-files-to-use-a-cdn</id>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="upgrading-your-django-media-&#xFB01;les-to-use-a-cdn">
<h3>Upgrading your Django media &#xFB01;les to use a&nbsp;<span class="caps">CDN</span></h3>
<p>I was using <a class="reference external" href="http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-&#xFB01;lebrowser/en/latest/">django-&#xFB01;lebrowser</a> on a project and my Rackspace <span class="caps">VM</span> quickly ran
out of disk space. Since the site isn&#8217;t getting much traf&#xFB01;c at all, I didn&#8217;t
want to pay extra for a bigger <span class="caps">VM</span>. Instead, I decided to move all of the user
uploaded media to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/&#xFB01;les/">Rackspace Cloud&#xFB01;les</a>. It&#8217;s super cheap and they have a
nice&nbsp;<span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
<p>Now, the challenge was to make the transition from a &#xFB01;lebrowser-based system.
First of all, I knew I was going to use <a class="reference external" href="http://django-storages.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">django-storages</a> as the new storage
class for my class. I played around with it on the side and it worked like a&nbsp;charm.</p>
<p>Next, I wrote a quick little Python script to upload all of the &#xFB01;les to
Cloud&#xFB01;les. Since the &#xFB01;lenames didn&#8217;t change at all, I could just write a
South migration that would strip the <tt class="docutils literal">/uploads</tt> part and be done with&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I had a look at the Django documentation to see what exactly a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/models/&#xFB01;elds/#&#xFB01;le&#xFB01;eld">FileField</a> was.
It turns out it takes a Django <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/&#xFB01;les/&#xFB01;le/#django.core.&#xFB01;les.File">File</a> object which in turn is a thin wrapper
around the Python built-in &#xFB01;le object. This didn&#8217;t sound exactly easy to do. I
would have to open a remote &#xFB01;le with Python&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">open(&#8216;&#xFB01;le.mp3&#8217;)</span></tt> and have
Django inspect it for size and &#xFB01;le type. This is clunky at best if you
remember that this will have to live in a South&nbsp;migration.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is the fact that &#xFB01;lebrowser&#8217;s model &#xFB01;eld is a subclass of
<tt class="docutils literal">CharField</tt> and has no special &#xFB01;le-related properties or&nbsp;methods.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t use the <tt class="docutils literal">DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS</tt> setting because &#xFB01;lebrowser will
start yelling at you. Instead, you specify the storage class right in the new
model&nbsp;&#xFB01;eld.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">storages.backends.mosso</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">cloud&#xFB01;les_upload_to</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">CloudFilesStorage</span>
<span class="n">cloud&#xFB01;les_storage</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">CloudFilesStorage</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Item</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">old_&#xFB01;eld</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">FileBrowseField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">500</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">blank</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">new_&#xFB01;eld</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FileField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">upload_to</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">cloud&#xFB01;les_upload_to</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="n">storage</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">cloud&#xFB01;les_storage</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">default</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now you can go and write your migration and Django won&#8217;t yell at you. Now we go
back to the problem outlined above. How do you create an instance of <tt class="docutils literal">File</tt>
to pass to <tt class="docutils literal">item.new_&#xFB01;eld</tt>.</p>
<p>After hours of reading the source and debugging, I realized that you can simply
pass in the &#xFB01;lename as a string and the storage class will do the right thing.
It&#8217;s actually really simple and painless. Your data migration might look
something&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">orm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new_&#xFB01;eld</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">basename</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">old_&#xFB01;eld</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So, I was already somewhat overjoyed that this would in fact be easy and then I
discovered that the change from &#xFB01;lebrowser to django-storages doesn&#8217;t require
a schema migration. This means that if your &#xFB01;le names are the same there is no
database change needed at all. How cool is&nbsp;that?</p>

<h3>Inerrancy</h3>
<p>As evangelical Christians, we believe in what is called the inerrancy of the
Bible. This means that we believe that the Word of God contains no mistakes. I
love the way pastor Mark Driscoll puts&nbsp;it:</p>
<blockquote>
If we see something in the Bible that we don&#8217;t agree with, it means we&#8217;re
wrong.</blockquote>
<p>I am continually amazed at how many people will dismiss entire passages in the
Bible as silly or primitive. We are intelligent modern people, we don&#8217;t believe
in fairy tales. We have democracy now. We believe in&nbsp;equality.</p>
<p>Let me remind you that the Bible is the book that God wrote. Is God different
today and&nbsp;yesterday?</p>
<p>Augustine:</p>
<blockquote>
If you believe what you like in the gospel, and reject what you don&#8217;t like,
it is not the gospel you believe, but yourself.</blockquote>
<p>D. A.&nbsp;Carson:</p>
<blockquote>
Those who don&#8217;t have a high view of Scripture, do not feel bound to obey
it.</blockquote>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="writing-node-js-modules">
<h3>Writing Node.js&nbsp;modules</h3>
<p>To say that node.js has enjoyed a great deal of positive publicity in the last
few months would most certainly be an understatement. New node.js-related
projects are popping up all over the place, and there seems to be this notion
that if you aren&#8217;t using it you&#8217;re not cool&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Over the Christmas holidays, I sat down to sort out my photo library and I
wanted to make a web photo gallery to share the images with family and friends.
Being a mainly Python programmer, I wrote a Python script that will go through
all of my photos and create smaller versions and thumbnails of the images that
are suitable for the web. I think I have around 1500 images at the moment and
it took a good 20 minutes to convert everything using Python Imaging&nbsp;Library.</p>
<p>I was rather frustrated with the performance. I think the reason for the
slowness was the fact that the images were processed sequentially, one by one.
What if I could modify my program to process more than one image at a time.
This would certainly speed by the process. Then I thought about using threads
in Python and I think I threw up in my mouth a&nbsp;little.</p>
<p>Then I remembered Node.js. It&#8217;s supposed to be all asynchronous and
non-blocking. Perfect match. So I wrote a thumbnailer in&nbsp;node.</p>
<p>Essentially, it&#8217;s a worker queue that resizes images. You give it a source and
destination directories and a number of workers and run it. The total time went
from 20 minutes to 2 using about 5 workers. Much better,&nbsp;eh?</p>
<p>I decided to open source the project because I couldn&#8217;t &#xFB01;nd any node.js
projects that do something even remotely similar. It&#8217;s called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/honza/node-thumbnail">node-thumbnail</a>
and you can &#xFB01;nd it on both Github and&nbsp;npmjs.</p>
<p>So what does the <span class="caps">API</span> look&nbsp;like?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">thumb</span><span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="nx">source</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;source/path&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">destination</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;dest/path&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">concurrency</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">4</span>
  <span class="p">},</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;All done!&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="interpretation-mistakes">
<h3>Interpretation&nbsp;mistakes</h3>
<p>Many people today who claim to be and likely are sincere followers of Jesus
Christ aren&#8217;t properly educated in the discipline of biblical exegesis and
interpretation. Of course not everyone can or wants to go to seminary to study
this topic. We can&#8217;t fault people to be ignorant about rather complex&nbsp;matters.</p>
<p>However, an introduction to the art of interpretation wouldn&#8217;t hurt anyone. My
reasoning behind this assertion is that the lack of basic understanding of
exegesis causes <em>unnecessary</em> con&#xFB02;ict within the church. In the rest of this
articles, I would like to show an example of this. Please bear in mind that the
arguments presented here aren&#8217;t meant to convince anyone of any particular
position, but rather, to show how dif&#xFB01;cult these arguments can&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive right in. Many people in the church today argue over the issue of
women&#8217;s position within the Christian society. Some argue that they are equal
to men in all regards and some argue that God created men and women in his
image but for different purposes. This becomes an issue in two particular
passages: Ephesians 5 where we learn of how the husband and the wife are to
conduct themselves in the marriage; and 1 Timothy 2 where Paul forbids women
from entering into the of&#xFB01;ce of an&nbsp;elder.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the Ephesians passage &#xFB01;rst. When women read that passage, the
&#xFB01;rst thing they think is that they are by no means going submit to their
husbands because they live in a society that doesn&#8217;t discriminated based on
gender. They dismiss the biblical account based on how they see themselves in
the 21st century society. The Pauline theology is deemed out-dated and
irrelevant to the modern person. If instead they read on and paid attention to
what the husband&#8217;s responsibilities are, they might learn that much greater
burden is placed upon him. The husband is to love his wife with the same love
that Christ loves the church! The same love with which the Father loves the
Son. The sacri&#xFB01;cial love that allowed Jesus to suffer and die for undeserving
sinners. And that&#8217;s no small&nbsp;task!</p>
<p>The passage from Timothy is dismissed on similar grounds. A women is as able as
a man and shouldn&#8217;t be told to refrain from entering into of&#xFB01;ce based on her
being a woman. However, this passage says nothing of competency or
intelligence. The passage in question in question reads as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<blockquote>
I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man;
rather, she is to remain quiet. For Adam was formed &#xFB01;rst, then Eve; and
Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a
transgressor. 1 Timothy 2:12-14</blockquote>
<p>In this case, it&#8217;s a question of language that is being ignored. What is Paul&#8217;s
reason for forbidding the woman from teaching? The order of creation. When God
was &#xFB01;nished creating the world, he announced that it was very good. This was
before the sin entered into the world. Paul <em>grounds</em> his argument in the work
of God. He follows God&#8217;s hand in history and is consistent with it. This means
that we cannot dismiss this instruction as having come from a particular city
where women were causing problems and meaning that it doesn&#8217;t apply to&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>The biggest problem in today&#8217;s layperson interpretation is that they project
their own ideas onto the biblical text and refuse to accept those verses and
ideas that don&#8217;t align with they own. This is a very &#xFB02;awed approach. Rather,
we should approach the Bible with an attitude of awe, expecting the God of the
universe to speak to use in his in&#xFB01;nite wisdom. Sadly, a great many people
today choose to ignore their God and pursue their own egos and&nbsp;agendas.</p>

<h3>Programmers and sore&nbsp;eyes</h3>
<p>Under normal circumstances, the human eye should blink about once every 5
seconds. When you stare at an <span class="caps">LCD</span> screen all day long, the blink interval gets
larger. As a result, your eyes become dry and sore. This is further worsened by
coffee. Drinking lots of water and using over-the-counter drops will help. This
is what my eye doctor told me&nbsp;yesterday.</p>

<h3>Data-driven javascript&nbsp;applications</h3>
<p>Over the last few weeks, I have been trying to think of a way to design medium
to large client-heavy web applications. There are many projects and ideas
&#xFB02;oating around that are meant to help you with this and I have had a look at
quite a few of them. I don&#8217;t mean to say that I found the best one &#8212; just one
that I&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>I want to talk about data-driven applications. What I mean is that everything
you do somehow manipulates or shows speci&#xFB01;c data. Let me describe what I mean
by a way of example. I have been working on a piece of photo gallery software
called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/honza/rembrant">rembrant</a>. The interface for actually organizing your images into
albums is very&nbsp;client-heavy.</p>
<p>The user interface is similar to that of iPhoto. The larger panel displays a
grid of small thumbnails. The sidebar shows a list of albums and a count of
selected&nbsp;images.</p>
<p>When the application loads, it makes two calls to the server: one to get a list
of all images (image models, including metadata), and a second to get album
information. Everything else in the <span class="caps">UI</span> is based on these two lists. The list of
albums and the image grid are pretty&nbsp;self-explanatory.</p>
<p>Once the browser has this data, we can start building out the <em>views</em>. A view
is a little windows, or a perspective upon a piece of data. It&#8217;s meant to
display the data in a meaningful way to the user. For example, in our
application, there is a list of albums in the sidebar. These are represented as
list items with anchor&nbsp;tags:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">SidebarView</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Backbone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">View</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kr">extends</span><span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="nx">el</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;#sidebar&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>

  <span class="nx">events</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;click #new-album-link&#39;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;newAlbum&#39;</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>

  <span class="nx">initialize</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">collection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">bind</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;reset&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">render</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">);</span>

  <span class="p">},</span>

  <span class="nx">add</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">album</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">albumView</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">SidebarAlbumView</span><span class="p">({</span>
      <span class="nx">model</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">album</span>

    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">albumView</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">el</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>

  <span class="nx">render</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">collection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">models</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
      <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">collection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">models</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">]);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Here you can see we are binding the view to an existing <span class="caps">DOM</span> element with an <span class="caps">ID</span>
of <em>sidebar</em>. The <tt class="docutils literal">&#64;collection</tt> variable is the collection of albums we spoke
about earlier. The view subscribes to the collection&#8217;s <em>reset</em> and <em>add</em>
events. When a new album is added to the collection, the view will
automatically update itself. Also, the <em>events</em> hash allows us to bind event
handlers to <span class="caps">DOM</span> elements in the&nbsp;sidebar.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I&#8217;m using Backbone to actually structure the
application. I &#xFB01;nd that Backbone provides a good compromise between structure
and freedom to do as you please. To be honest, it took me a good while to wrap
my head around what Backbone is trying to do for you. It may seem a little
wordy at times but you shouldn&#8217;t expect your application to consist of little&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>Now, suppose we wanted to add a count to each album list item which would
indicate how many photos are currently in that album. This is easily done by
inspecting the photos collection. Backbone provides a simple way to &#xFB01;lter your
collection based on prede&#xFB01;ned criteria. To get all photos that belong to the
album with an <span class="caps">ID</span> of <tt class="docutils literal">1</tt>, we would&nbsp;do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">PhotoCollection</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">Backbone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Collection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kr">extends</span><span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="nx">model</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">Photo</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">url</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/photos&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>

  <span class="nx">byAlbum</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">&#xFB01;lter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">photo</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
     <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">_</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">indexOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">photo</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;albums&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nx">id</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span>

<span class="c1">// collection is an instance of PhotoCollection</span>
<span class="nx">photos</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">collection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">byAlbum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As you can see, this is very simple and elegant. Now, if a photo is deleted, it
will be removed from the collection. This will be re&#xFB02;ected both in the grid
and in the sidebar. It will all work automatically because all of the views are
looking at the same date. They are subscribed to the data&#8217;s events and react&nbsp;accordingly.</p>
<p>The nice thing is that you don&#8217;t have to worry about changing classes, binding
data to <span class="caps">DOM</span> elements, attaching click handlers, making <span class="caps">AJAX</span> requests, none of
this. The dif&#xFB01;cult part about this approach is deciding what your elementary
data is and how you should get it. In the case of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/honza/rembrant">rembrant</a> it was pretty&nbsp;simple.</p>

                <div class="section" id="on-why-we-lack-mature-christians">
<h3>On why we lack mature&nbsp;Christians</h3>
<p>The leadership in the local church is often made up of very incompetent people.
I don&#8217;t mean incompetent in the sense that they can&#8217;t lead. I mean in their
knowledge and understanding of theology in general and of the gospel in
particular. The Bible says that the leaders in the church should be &#xFB01;rst and
foremost able to teach. If you can&#8217;t teach the Bible, perform mature exegesis
on a text or even struggle to &#xFB01;nd a book in the Bible, you shouldn&#8217;t lead.
Yet, this happens all the time. I have a theory on how this&nbsp;happens.</p>
<p>The local church often runs programs that are designed to attract seekers.
People come and are lead to Christ. They pray the sinner&#8217;s prayer and are
introduced to church life. The original group of evangelists moves on to reach
new people and the new believer is left mostly alone in the sea of church
goers. There is rarely any follow-up. These people are left to themselves. New
believers tend to be very excited about their new-found faith and they read
their Bibles whenever they get a&nbsp;chance.</p>
<p>Time goes on and these new believers learn to walk the walk and talk the talk
in the church. They learn some key concepts about how church life works. They
learn stories from the gospels, they memorize a few verses from Paul&#8217;s epistles
and they feel good about themselves. They listen to sermons, they go to prayer
meetings and help out where they can. On the outside, it seems that they have
it all &#xFB01;gured out and their walk with Christ has been&nbsp;fruitful.</p>
<p>Once they have been in the church for some 30 years, they naturally gravitate
towards leadership roles. They are nominated to serve on the deacon&#8217;s board or
on the &#xFB01;nance committee. Their sense of self-worth rises. They begin to think
that since they made it to their new leadership role, they must be a really
good Christian. After all, they have been in the church for over 30 years. They
have been coming every Sunday, participated in programs and lots&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>However, they haven&#8217;t been under good Bible teaching. They haven&#8217;t read their
Bibles in years because they&#8217;ve got it all &#xFB01;gured out. They know all the
stories and parables. They know the hymns and worship songs. But they don&#8217;t
know basic Christian doctrine. They wouldn&#8217;t be able to explain to you the
doctrine of sancti&#xFB01;cation, justi&#xFB01;cation or redemption. They lack
understanding of the divine&nbsp;economy.</p>
<p>Moreover, they haven&#8217;t walked with Christ and therefore lack the practical
knowledge of his grace. They don&#8217;t pray on a daily basis to align their hearts
with the will of God. They are proud and feel a strong sense of entitlement and
deservedness. They don&#8217;t re&#xFB02;ect on the depths of God and his royal
magni&#xFB01;cence. They are obsessed with legalism and rule-keeping. They think that
if they were able to make this far, anyone can. They value tradition. Why
change things if they have worked for so many years? They aren&#8217;t willing to
learn because they know it all. They won&#8217;t come to basic Christianity classes
because it would be boring for&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>The saddest thing about this reality is that we allow these unlearned people to
make decisions that impact the life of the wider&nbsp;congregation.</p>
<p>What about those who grow up in the church? They have even tougher times
getting to the truth because of the older generation that is in power. If you
don&#8217;t read the Bible for yourself, why would you read it for to your children?
If you don&#8217;t understand a particular text in the Scriptures, how could your&nbsp;wife?</p>

<h3>Steve Jobs and Richard&nbsp;Stallman</h3>
<p>Today, news <a class="reference external" href="http://stallman.org/archives/2011-jul-oct.html#06_October_2011_(Steve_Jobs)">broke</a> about Richard Stallman&#8217;s comment on Steve Job&#8217;s death. The
news of the giant&#8217;s passing has stirred up a wave of emotions ranging from
utter sadness to feelings of empowerment to do great things. Tributes were paid
to Steve Jobs all over the internet. His life is described as one of a genius.
Technology celebrities have publicly commented on his&nbsp;death.</p>
<p>Richard Stallman said the&nbsp;following:</p>
<blockquote>
I&#8217;m not glad he&#8217;s dead, but I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s gone.</blockquote>
<p>While this could have been said better, I&#8217;m absolutely shocked by the harsh
comments the community has made towards Dr Stallman. I&#8217;m not trying to defend
him. He is a caricature like no other. The man possesses no social skills. But
he is a respected computer engineer that has changed the way software works
today. He has a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Recognition">number</a> of doctorates. Like Steve Jobs, Dr Stallman is a
programming genius. His work on the <span class="caps">GCC</span> compiler is&nbsp;substantial.</p>
<p>Articles like the on <a class="reference external" href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/10/why-fsf-founder-richard-stallm.php">ReadWriteWeb</a> are very disappointing. Let&#8217;s all be
civil and respectful of each&nbsp;other.</p>

<h3>On heaven and&nbsp;boredom</h3>
<p>One of the complaints many atheists raise against becoming a Christian is the
fact that heaven will be boring. They have in their minds this idea of us in
heaven as chubby toddlers in diapers playing harps and &#xFB02;ying around. To me
that would be&nbsp;hell.</p>
<p>I would like to talk to you about why I think that heaven won&#8217;t be boring. Let
me start by telling you a how my high school teacher explained to us the
concept of geometric parallels. She said they were two lines that didn&#8217;t
intersect or touch. She also made a side note that the two parallels will
intersect at one speci&#xFB01;c point, being&nbsp;in&#xFB01;nity.</p>
<p>It takes the two parallel lines all of in&#xFB01;nity to reach each other. Now, keep
that in mind while we look at some&nbsp;Scripture.</p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and
they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. &#8211;
Revelation 21:3, <span class="caps">ESV</span></blockquote>
<p>The Bible says that God will live with us, among us, so we can know Him fully.
God is omnipotent, omniscient and in&#xFB01;nite. To comprehend all of the depths of
God, all his wisdom, love and grace, we will need a long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>How long? Well, it&#8217;s easy. Exactly <em>one eternity</em>.</p>

                <div class="section" id="bible-translations-and-the-christian-life">
<h3>Bible translations and the Christian&nbsp;life</h3>
<p>There are many English translations of the Bible. They were all made for
different audiences. They employ different translation techniques. Each
Christian celebrity endorses a different&nbsp;translation.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that a certain Bible translation can be elevated to
such a degree that the common believer is made to believe that the translation
contains actual words of God. You need to realize that a translation is just
that: a translation. No matter how many scholars with the best schools you
commission to create this new, true translation of the Scriptures, it is bound
to be imperfect in some way. One language cannot accurately convey the same
meaning as an another. Each language carries with it a certain culture, sense
of humor and ways of expressing common&nbsp;idioms.</p>
<p>This is perhaps a little hard to understand if you only speak one language. If
you have had to learn English and you moved to foreign country, this idea may
be clearer to&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>So, where do you go from here? As you may know, the Bible was written in three
languages: Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. As Christians, we focus most of our
attention on the New Testament which is written in&nbsp;Greek.</p>
<p>I am going to suggest that if you are even remotely interested in serious study
of the Word of God that you invest a few years of your life and learn New
Testament Greek. Now you are thinking that I&#8217;m completely crazy. Bear with me
for a&nbsp;moment.</p>
<p>The vocabulary of the New Testament is &#xFB01;nal. You don&#8217;t need to learn words
like <em>airplane</em>, <em>computer</em> or <em>email</em>. If you learn only 300 Greek words, you
will understand over 80% of the New Testament; double the amount and you will
get up to 90%. I&#8217;m con&#xFB01;dent that after a year of casual study of Greek you can
begin to read some of the simpler passages (like 1 John). After another year,
you will read Paul&#8217;s writing without much&nbsp;hindrance.</p>
<p>After 3-4 years, you will be ready to abandon reading the New Testament in
English altogether. Let that sink&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>There are plenty of good resource for learning New Testament Greek. Both online
and in&nbsp;print.</p>
<p>One last thing: if you are in your twenties or event thirties and you expect to
be alive for another 50-60 years, wouldn&#8217;t it be a good investment to spend a
few years learning the language Paul, Luke, John and others spoke and wrote&nbsp;in?</p>

<h3>Using Chef with small Django&nbsp;apps</h3>
<p>This year at <a class="reference external" href="http://djangocon.us">DjangoCon</a>, it seemed like everybody was talking about automatic
deployments and namely <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a>. After coming home from the conference, I spent
a considerable amount of time learning chef and thinking about how it can be
best used with small to medium size Django apps. In this post, I will walk you
through how Chef works and how it can help you make awesome web&nbsp;apps.</p>
<p>When I say small apps, I mean single-server deployments. This means that your
web server, your database, memcached, rabbitmq, etc is installed on a single
Ubuntu <span class="caps">VM</span>. When learning Chef, I found that most of the available tutorials
focus on multi-server setups and are too complex for ordinary&nbsp;apps.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Chef is written in Ruby and it can be a little tricky to debug
since all the tracebacks are meaningless to a Python developer. However, don&#8217;t
despair, you can usually tell pretty quickly what&#8217;s going on. To test your
deployment, we will be using <a class="reference external" href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> which is an awesome tool for running
virtual machines on your development&nbsp;machine.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-will-install">
<h4>What we will&nbsp;install</h4>
<p>Our Django application will be deployed using the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>nginx</li>
<li>gunicorn</li>
<li>postgresql</li>
<li>memcached</li>
<li>rabbitmq</li>
<li>git</li>
</ul>
<p>Your development machine will need to have <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.fab&#xFB01;le.org/en/1.2.2/index.html">Fabric</a>&nbsp;installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-chef-works">
<h4>How Chef&nbsp;works</h4>
<p>Chef is a tool that is installed on your server. You give it a bunch
con&#xFB01;guration &#xFB01;les and tell it to provision server with the necessary packages
and settings. This means that our automatic deployment will have to parts: Chef
con&#xFB01;guration &#xFB01;les for the sever, and several Fabric tasks to install Chef
remotely and start the provisioning&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>So, to con&#xFB01;gure Chef, we will create a <em>deploy</em> directory inside our project&#8217;s
repository. I like to keep the following&nbsp;structure:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> ls -a
<span class="go">.git coolapp docs deploy <span class="caps">README</span>.md Vagrant&#xFB01;le fab&#xFB01;le.py</span>
</pre></div>
<p>&#8230; where <em>coolapp</em> is your Django project. We will focus on the <em>deploy</em>
directory and the <em>fab&#xFB01;le</em>. Chef is a cook how prepares your server for
dinner. So, Chef needs some cookbooks and recipes. Each cookbook is a directory
that contains various con&#xFB01;guration &#xFB01;les for a speci&#xFB01;c application that you
want installed. So for example, you will have a <em>PostgreSQL cookbook</em> and a
<em>nginx cookbook</em>. The  deploy directory will contain a directory called
<em>cookbooks</em> which will contain all other cookbooks. Now, the good news is that
you don&#8217;t have to make the cookbooks yourself. <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opscode.com">Opscode</a>, the company behind
Chef, maintains a large selection of cookbooks on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/opscode/cookbooks">Github</a>. You can copy and
paste the cookbooks you need for you project. We will need the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>build-essential (for building from&nbsp;source)</li>
<li>erlang (rabbitmq depends on&nbsp;this)</li>
<li>git</li>
<li>memcached</li>
<li>nginx</li>
<li>postgresql</li>
<li>python (for virtualenv and python header&nbsp;&#xFB01;les)</li>
<li>rabbitmq</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cookbooks">
<h4>Cookbooks</h4>
<p>Each cookbook contains a <em>recipes</em> directory. Each recipe tells Chef how this
particular application is to be installed and con&#xFB01;gured. For example, it will
tell nginx to create an entry in <em>sites-available</em> and <em>sites-enabled</em>. Or, it
will restart PostreSQL when it&#8217;s done being&nbsp;installed.</p>
<p>There is also a <em>&#xFB01;les</em> directory and a <em>templates</em> directory. Templates are
Ruby templates which de&#xFB01;ne a particular con&#xFB01;guration &#xFB01;le. For example, in
order for Chef to be able to properly con&#xFB01;gure nginx with the proper server
name, it needs to know on what domain your application will be hosted. More on
this later, but there is a master &#xFB01;le which has all your settings in it and
Chef reads from that and substitutes the necessary values. The <em>&#xFB01;les</em>
directory contains &#xFB01;les that need no further modi&#xFB01;cation and can be copied
over&nbsp;verbatim.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="node-json">
<h4>node.json</h4>
<p>The <em>node.json</em> &#xFB01;le is a per project &#xFB01;le that speci&#xFB01;es certain values for
Chef to use. For example, you can tell Chef what you want your PostgreSQL
database to be called, what the name of your django project is, etc. It has a
simple <span class="caps">JSON</span>&nbsp;syntax.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="your-app-s-recipe">
<h4>Your app&#8217;s&nbsp;recipe</h4>
<p>Your application is going to need a simple recipe. This means creating a
cookbook bearing your project&#8217;s name and creating a <em>recipes</em> directory within
in. The recipe should be called <em>default.rb</em> and all it needs to include is a
list of applications to install. For&nbsp;example:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1"># Example django app cookbook</span>

<span class="n">execute</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Update apt repos&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">command</span> <span class="s2">&quot;apt-get update&quot;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">include_recipe</span> <span class="s1">&#39;nginx&#39;</span>
<span class="n">include_recipe</span> <span class="s1">&#39;build-essential&#39;</span>
<span class="n">include_recipe</span> <span class="s1">&#39;python&#39;</span>
<span class="n">include_recipe</span> <span class="s1">&#39;postgresql::server&#39;</span>
<span class="n">include_recipe</span> <span class="s1">&#39;memcached&#39;</span>
<span class="n">include_recipe</span> <span class="s1">&#39;runit&#39;</span>
<span class="n">include_recipe</span> <span class="s1">&#39;git&#39;</span>

<span class="n">execute</span> <span class="s2">&quot;restart postgres&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">command</span> <span class="s2">&quot;sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.4 restart&quot;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="n">execute</span> <span class="s2">&quot;create-database&quot;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">command</span> <span class="s2">&quot;createdb -U postgres -O postgres </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">node</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:dbname</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can see it&#8217;s pretty simple. We update Ubuntu&#8217;s repositories, include some
recipes, restart PostgreSQL and create a new&nbsp;database.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="start-the-engines">
<h4>Start the&nbsp;engines</h4>
<p>At this point, you can try out your con&#xFB01;guration with Vagrant. To help you
out, I have create a <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/honza/django-chef">template</a> project on Github that you can download and
use out of the&nbsp;box.</p>
<p>The next big part is writing the Fabric scripts. You will want the following&nbsp;tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="&#xFB01;rst">Install&nbsp;Chef</p>
</li>
<li><p class="&#xFB01;rst">Transfer the cookbooks directory to the&nbsp;server</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="&#xFB01;rst docutils">
<dt>Bootstrap the Django&nbsp;project</dt>
<dd><ul class="&#xFB01;rst last simple">
<li>Moving code to the&nbsp;server</li>
<li>Creating a&nbsp;virtualenv</li>
<li>Installing&nbsp;requirements</li>
<li>Syncing the&nbsp;database</li>
<li>Running&nbsp;migrations</li>
<li>Starting&nbsp;gunicorn</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p class="&#xFB01;rst">Deploy</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see how I implemented mine <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/honza/django-chef/blob/master/fab&#xFB01;le.py">here</a>. I recommend that you use Fabric&#8217;s
<em>roledefs</em> which will allow you to specify vagrant as the&nbsp;host:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> fab -R vagrant bootstrap
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-real-thing">
<h4>The real&nbsp;thing</h4>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve tested your application in Vagrant so you are ready to deploy to a
server. All that&#8217;s left to do is create a new <em>roledef</em> in the <em>fab&#xFB01;le</em> and
run&nbsp;it!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>I am by no means a Chef expert&#8212;I learned how to use it a few days ago. If you
have any feedback, do let me&nbsp;know.</p>

<h3>Google APIs - Y U <span class="caps">NO</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">WORK</span></h3>
<p>Recently, at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sheepdoginc.ca">SheepDogInc</a>, I have been working with various Google APIs,
especially the Calendar <span class="caps">API</span>. The state of these APIs is rather <em>unfortunate</em>.
Google is a web giant and you&#8217;d think that their APIs would be state-of-the-art
given the number of professionals they&nbsp;employ.</p>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h4>Documentation</h4>
<p>Before we go anywhere, let me just talk about the documentation for a minute.
As an open-source software author and advocate, I always encourage developers
to write extensive and good documentation. Somehow, Google didn&#8217;t get the demo.
Most of their documentation is sparse, incorrect and out-of-date. If you would
like to know what data a call returns, you&#8217;re better off just making the call
and inspecting the response. This will actually save you time because the docs
are probably wrong&nbsp;anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reliability">
<h4>Reliability</h4>
<p>Google is like the master of scalability. They have an estimated one million
servers world-wide. And yet, they cannot consistently return a 200 to an <span class="caps">API</span>
call. I have written horrible, horrible glue code and hacky workarounds to
account for this unpredictability. Sometimes you will get a response, sometimes
it will timeout, sometime you will get a&nbsp;404&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="engineering">
<h4>Engineering</h4>
<p>With all these amazing engineers, can Google really not make a better <span class="caps">API</span>?
Honestly, if I was in a position to hire a person who worked on the Google <span class="caps">API</span>
team, I would think twice. Seriously &#8212; test your app, keep your docs
up-to-date, and mainly, stop pissing me&nbsp;off!</p>

<h3>DjangoCon 2011&nbsp;Take-Aways</h3>
<p>My employer, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sheepdoginc.ca/">SheepDogInc</a>, sent me and a colleague of mine to <a class="reference external" href="http://djangocon.us/">DjangoCon
2011</a>. It was my &#xFB01;rst developer conference and I had a blast. Here a few
quick points about what the conference has clari&#xFB01;ed for&nbsp;me.</p>
<div class="section" id="deploying-django">
<h4>Deploying&nbsp;Django</h4>
<p>Despite the Django of&#xFB01;cial documentation&#8217;s recommendation to use Apache and
mod_wsgi, most people seem to deploy Django with nginx and gunicorn. This has
been a pleasant surprise to me because I like it but though that it was too
simple (or less robust than&nbsp;Apache).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="provisioning-servers">
<h4>Provisioning&nbsp;servers</h4>
<p>It seemed that everybody was talking about <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> and automatic deployments.
Instead of manually connecting to a server via ssh, you can run one command
which will install all the necessary packages for your application (nginx,
postgresql, etc) and con&#xFB01;gure them. It makes the whole process less
error-prone. Also, you&#8217;re more likely to spin up a new <span class="caps">VM</span> on your development
machine to try things out because you don&#8217;t have to thing about setting it up.
Especially with tools like <a class="reference external" href="http://vagrantup.com/">vagrant</a>, it&#8217;s dead&nbsp;easy.</p>

<p>When I was a kid, our family used to travel a lot. I grew up in central Europe
and over the years, we visited most of continental Europe. This was in the
early &#8216;90s. Usually, Mom would have a map on her lap and she would tell Dad
where to go. To keep me and my little brother entertained, they gave us another
map and we would follow&nbsp;along.</p>
<p>We had fun trying to pronounce funny city names and calculating distances that
we had travelled that day. Mostly, we had fun travelling in the car. Sometimes,
we would get lost though and tension in the car would rise. My brother and I
were always trying to help get us <em>unlost</em>. I remember thinking that it would
be so cool to have a tiny little car on the map to show you where you were so
you&#8217;d always know where you were&nbsp;going.</p>

<h3>Why I love&nbsp;reStructuredText</h3>
<p>A lot of geeks are using Markdown as their markup generation tool today. It&#8217;s
simple, effective and used everywhere. It allows you to focus on your content
and not on the <span class="caps">HTML</span> code that will be used to display the content on a web
page. I have used Markdown extensively and its simplicity is appealing to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">reStructuredText</a> is similar to Markdown. If you know Markdown, it&#8217;s dead
simple to learn to use <span class="caps">RST</span>. So, why bother? There are many things it can do
that Markdown simple wasn&#8217;t designed to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>Let me give you a bit of a background. As a programmer, I like to write and
save documents in text &#xFB01;les, using the vim editor. This way I can easily keep
track of different versions of those documents and I will always be able to
open them. The problem is that most non-technical people, such as my family or
perhaps your clients, are trained to use Word documents or <span class="caps">PDF</span> &#xFB01;les. Most
computer users wouldn&#8217;t know what to do with that &#xFB01;le and wouldn&#8217;t understand
the syntax. I was looking for a way to write my documents in text &#xFB01;les and
still be able to share those with others via Word/<span class="caps">PDF</span>. At &#xFB01;rst, I set up
simple LaTex templates. Then, I thought about writing a script to parse
Markdown &#xFB01;les to <span class="caps">PDF</span> via ReportLab. All very cumbersome and not quite&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>Then, I dicovered <span class="caps">RST</span>. It&#8217;s written in Python which means that any
customizations won&#8217;t be impossible. When I installed it, I was surprised that
it came with a set of command line tools to parse <span class="caps">RST</span> &#xFB01;les to other common
formats such&nbsp;as:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="caps">HTML</span></li>
<li><span class="caps">PDF</span> via&nbsp;Latex</li>
<li><span class="caps">ODT</span> (OpenOf&#xFB01;ce&nbsp;format)</li>
</ul>
<p>I played around a bit with the tools and found them useful, but not great. The
default formatting was ugly and it seemed like it would take too much work to
manually edit the embedded <span class="caps">CSS</span>/Latex/<span class="caps">ODT</span>&nbsp;styles.</p>
<p>I read through the documentation more and found out that you can set up global
or project speci&#xFB01;c con&#xFB01;guration &#xFB01;les that <span class="caps">RST</span> parsers will look for by
default. The syntax is simple and effective. This way, you only set up your
styles once and then all you have to do to convert those styles&nbsp;is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> rst2html.py doc.rst &gt; doc.html
</pre></div>
<p><span class="caps">RST</span> is extensible and you can con&#xFB01;gure it to do almost anything you want. Once
good example is Pygments syntax highlighting. You can add a new directive and
automatically run your code examples through Pygments. Or, you can customize
the LaTex writer to use a speci&#xFB01;c font, page size and lots&nbsp;more.</p>

                <div class="section" id="on-prayer-and-the-closing-of-the-eyes">
<h3>On prayer and the closing of the&nbsp;eyes</h3>
<p>Virtually every Christian has been taught that prayer is when you talk to God
with your eyes <em>closed</em>. We tell our children, &#8220;Close your eyes and we will
pray&#8221;. The idea of having your eyes closed when you pray is so engrained in our
culture that we don&#8217;t give it a second&nbsp;thought.</p>
<p>As protestant Christians, we believe that the Bible contains actual words of
God. We also believe in the suf&#xFB01;ciency of the Bible&#8217;s instruction. Let&#8217;s
survey the Scriptures and see what the proper mode and posture is when we&nbsp;pray.</p>
<p>In the English Standard Version translation of the Bible, the word <em>pray</em>
occurs ninety times. Fifty-three times of that is in the New Testament. These
verses describe prayer as urgent and emotional. For example, the Psalmist&nbsp;exclaims:</p>
<blockquote>
Give attention to the sound of my cry, my King and my God, for to you do I
pray. (Psalm 5:2, <span class="caps">ESV</span>)</blockquote>
<p>In the New Testament, the disciples ask Jesus to teach them how to pray. The
apostle Paul prays for his coworkers in the gospel. Jesus often prayed in
private, away from the crowds. However, we are not told any speci&#xFB01;cs. Jesus
also prayed in public. For example, in the story of feeding of the &#xFB01;ve&nbsp;thousand:</p>
<blockquote>
Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the &#xFB01;ve
loaves and the two &#xFB01;sh, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing.
(Matthew 14:19, <span class="caps">ESV</span>)</blockquote>
<p>Jesus is looking up to heaven, possibly stretching his arms and is speaking to
his father. The lifting of hands or arms is also described in 1 Timothy where
Paul is telling Timothy how a church service should be&nbsp;conducted:</p>
<blockquote>
I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands
without anger or quarreling; (1 Timothy 2:8, <span class="caps">ESV</span>)</blockquote>
<p>The Bible records many occasions where people pray to their God but in no
instance does it describe or prescribe that the believer&#8217;s eyes be closed. Why
do we do it then? I can think of a few different reasons. One, we don&#8217;t want to
embarrass the one leading the prayer; two, it helps us focus on the task at
hand; or, three, we want others around us to know that we are praying and
shouldn&#8217;t be&nbsp;disturbed.</p>
<p>These reasons are understandable and certainly not sinful in any way. But I do
believe that we rob ourselves of some joy by closing our eyes. If we only ever
pray with our eyes closed, we won&#8217;t pray very often. Prayer becomes a holy
moment that we plan ahead. Your prayer life should be an ongoing conversation
with your Father. Jesus prayed constantly. And so need&nbsp;we.</p>

A blog is a type of website or part of a website. Blogs are usually

<h2>Why I quit&nbsp;Facebook</h2>
<p>Many <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9217581/Facebook_loses_6M_U.S._users_in_May">reports</a> on the Internet have shown that Facebook has lost 6 million
users in North America. People are getting tired of Facebook. That and the
strange privacy problems and the allegations of <a
href="http://www.macworld.com/article/145646/2010/01/facebook.html">unwanted
tracking</a> aren&#8217;t
making things easier for Facebook. I recently <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/_honza/status/81130226880491520">deactivated</a> my Facebook
account and I thought I would post a few fun(ny) facts about&nbsp;Facebook.</p>

Every Facebook noti&#xFB01;cation: &#8220;Someone you don&#8217;t know did something you
don&#8217;t care about to some stupid thing a mutual friend posted.&#8221;

<h3>Why I don&#8217;t like the Ruby&nbsp;community</h3>
<p>I write Python and Javascript code. I use Django and jQuery. And I cringe every
time I have to run <tt class="docutils literal">gem install x</tt>. I only have a limited understanding of
Ruby and hardly any of Ruby on Rails. It seems disorganized to me and hard to
process. All this is &#xFB01;ne &#8211; I don&#8217;t have to use any of it if I don&#8217;t like it,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>I always knew there was something wrong with the way Ruby works. I don&#8217;t mean
wrong like murdering children, I just mean wrong like I don&#8217;t know why things
are the way they are. There are a lot of talented Ruby programmers and I don&#8217;t
mean to dismiss&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Recently, though, I came across a tweet that I made me realize what it was that
I didn&#8217;t like about Ruby. It was like a small&nbsp;revelation.</p>
<blockquote>
Markup is markup, not Ruby. JavaScript is JavaScript, not Ruby. <span class="caps">CSS</span> is <span class="caps">CSS</span>,
not Ruby. Get that in your head before I slap you. - <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/#!/ara_p/status/81425173965832193">&#64;ara_p</a></blockquote>
<p>Do you get it? <a class="reference external" href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html"><span class="caps">ERB</span></a> is Ruby with some html-like fragments mixed in.
<a class="reference external" href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> is a Ruby-like language that compiles to Javascript. <a class="reference external" href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> is

<p>Before you know it, everything will be in&nbsp;Ruby.</p>

<h3>Scalability and feet and&nbsp;asses</h3>
<p>I love talking about scalability. Everyone has their own opinion, their own way
of performing benchmarks and their own conclusions. And we all know that this
is <em>very</em> silly. I recently came across an article by <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/dozba">Ted Dziuba</a> that
summarizes it very nicely for&nbsp;you:</p>
<blockquote>
Shut up about scalability, no one is using your app anyway.</blockquote>
<p>I love how the author explains the use of the word <em>scalability</em> in this day
and&nbsp;age:</p>
<blockquote>
The most common butthurt about scalability is this: choose a technology. If
you like the technology, claim &#8220;technology X scales better!&#8221; If you don&#8217;t
like it, claim &#8220;technology X doesn&#8217;t scale!&#8221;</blockquote>

            <id>http://honza.ca/2011/05/deploying-django-with-nginx-and-gunicorn</id>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="deploying-django-with-nginx-and-gunicorn">
<h3>Deploying Django with nginx and&nbsp;gunicorn</h3>
<p>The amazing Django <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/howto/deployment/modwsgi/">documentation</a> recommends that you use Apache and modwsgi
to deploy your webapp. While this is certainly not bad advice, you may not want
to use Apache after all. Apache is a beast that eats up a lot of memory, is
kind of slow and can&#8217;t handle as much traf&#xFB01;c. As a fun alternative, I would
like to talk about deploying Django on nginx using the <a class="reference external" href="http://gunicorn.org/">gunicorn</a> web&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>Just a quick note before we start: this isn&#8217;t an out-there deployment option. I
spoke to one of the gunicorn developers and was told that every django hosting
company (think ep.io) uses this&nbsp;setup.</p>
<div class="section" id="get-your-server-ready">
<h4>Get your server&nbsp;ready</h4>
<p>I use Rackspace for small, single server web apps. I created an Ubuntu 10.10
instance with <span class="caps">256MB</span> of <span class="caps">RAM</span>. Then, I created a user for my app and added my ssh
key to <tt class="docutils literal">authorized_keys</tt>. Basic&nbsp;stuff.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="install-nginx">
<h4>Install&nbsp;nginx</h4>
<p>Installing nginx couldn&#8217;t be simpler. Latest stable release is provided via a
ppa&nbsp;repository.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> sudo apt-get install python-software-properties -y
<span class="gp">$</span> sudo -s
<span class="gp">$</span> apt-add-repository ppa:nginx/stable
<span class="gp">$</span> apt-get update
<span class="gp">$</span> apt-get install nginx
<span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">exit</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-structure">
<h4>Project&nbsp;structure</h4>
<p>The user under which the app will run is <tt class="docutils literal">webapp</tt>, so I checkout my app in
<tt class="docutils literal">/home/webapp</tt>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">/home/webapp/app</span>
<span class="go">/home/webapp/app/static</span>
<span class="go">/home/webapp/env</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that I&#8217;m using <tt class="docutils literal">virtualenv</tt> to deploy this&nbsp;app.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="con&#xFB01;gure-nginx-and-gunicorn">
<h4>Con&#xFB01;gure nginx and&nbsp;gunicorn</h4>
<p>The following two &#xFB01;les can be distributed with your&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>nginx.conf:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">server {</span>
<span class="go">    listen 80;</span>
<span class="go">    server_name webapp.org;</span>

<span class="go">    access_log /home/webapp/access.log;</span>
<span class="go">    error_log /home/webapp/error.log;</span>

<span class="go">    location /static {</span>
<span class="go">        root /home/webapp/app;</span>
<span class="go">    }</span>

<span class="go">    location / {</span>
<span class="go">        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8888;</span>
<span class="go">    }</span>
<span class="go">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Next, I symlinked <tt class="docutils literal">nginx.conf</tt> to the server&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sites-enabled</span></tt> directory.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> sudo ln -s /home/webapp/app/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enable/webapp.org
</pre></div>
<p>This sets up nginx to directly serve the applications&#8217;s static &#xFB01;les (css, js,
etc.). Everything else is proxied to the gunicorn&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>Now gunicorn is a Python <span class="caps">HTTP</span> server. It&#8217;s super simple and effective. I
installed it into the app&#8217;s&nbsp;environment.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="o">(</span>env<span class="o">)</span> pip install gunicorn
</pre></div>
<p>gunicorn.conf.py:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">bind</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;127.0.0.1:8888&quot;</span>
<span class="n">log&#xFB01;le</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;/home/webapp/gunicorn.log&quot;</span>
<span class="n">workers</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
</pre></div>
<p>That&#8217;s it! The con&#xFB01;g &#xFB01;les are simple and easy to&nbsp;read.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running">
<h4>Running</h4>
<p>I then collected all the static &#xFB01;les into the <tt class="docutils literal">static</tt> directory:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="o">(</span>env<span class="o">)</span> python manage.py collectstatic
</pre></div>
<p>I restarted&nbsp;nginx:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart
</pre></div>
<p>And &#xFB01;nally, I ran the <tt class="docutils literal">gunicorn</tt> server:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="o">(</span>env<span class="o">)</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> /home/webapp/app
<span class="gp">$</span> <span class="o">(</span>env<span class="o">)</span> gunicorn_django -D -c gunicorn.conf.py
</pre></div>
<p>And I was good to&nbsp;go.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notes">
<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>You may have to change the permissions on the <tt class="docutils literal">static</tt> directory. Also, the
command above starts <tt class="docutils literal">gunicorn</tt> as a deamon - a better way would be to use a
monitoring service to start it. Think <tt class="docutils literal">runit</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">supervisord</tt>. Also, I
didn&#8217;t include any database speci&#xFB01;c con&#xFB01;gurations since that&#8217;s indentical to
an Apache&nbsp;deployment.</p>

            <title>The importance of git rebase</title>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="the-importance-of-git-rebase">
<h3>The importance of git&nbsp;rebase</h3>
<p>Git isn&#8217;t just something you have to put up with when working with other
developers. Git is a wonderful tool that allows you to manage your code, its
evolution and help you recover from mistakes should they arise. One of the
things that people are intimidated by is <tt class="docutils literal">git rebase</tt>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example. You&#8217;re working on a team with two other developers.
You have a blessed repository that sits on your company&#8217;s server. Everyone is
working on the same project but on slightly different tasks. Everyone is
working on the master branch. You write a bit of code here and there, you
commit a bunch of times and then it&#8217;s time to share your code with the rest of
the team by pushing it up to the shared&nbsp;repository.</p>
<p>You run <tt class="docutils literal">git push</tt> but receive an error saying that there are changes on the
server and your commit cannot be fast-forwarded. No big deal, right? You run
<tt class="docutils literal">git pull</tt> to download the changes that you don&#8217;t have and automatically
merge your changes in. Then you can <tt class="docutils literal">git push</tt> again and it will work just&nbsp;&#xFB01;ne.</p>
<p>The problem is that it makes the history of your project&nbsp;messy.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">* 9:35 - Nancy - Merge branch &#39;master&#39;</span>
<span class="go">|\</span>
<span class="go">* | 9:35 - Nancy - Second commit</span>
<span class="go">| |</span>
<span class="go">| * 9:30 - Brad - First commit</span>
<span class="go">|/</span>
<span class="go">* 9:12 - Nancy - First commit</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As you can see, there is this strange <strong>Merge branch &#8216;master&#8217;</strong> commit that&#8217;s a
little out of place. If everyone on your team is regularly pushing to the
shared repository, the history gets littered with these weird commits pretty&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>You may have guessed that there is a better way. We&#8217;ll replay the above
scenario using <tt class="docutils literal">git rebase</tt>. Instead of running <cite>git pull</cite>, we will run <tt class="docutils literal">git
pull <span class="pre">&#8211;rebase</span></tt>. What this will do is temporarily hide the commits that only you
have, then pull the changes from the remote repository, fast-forward (no merge
commit) and then re-apply your commits on top of the current <span class="caps">HEAD</span>. The end
result from a code point of view is the same, but the history is much&nbsp;cleaner:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">* 9:35 - Nancy - Second commit</span>
<span class="go">* 9:30 - Brad - First commit</span>
<span class="go">* 9:12 - Nancy - First commit</span>
</pre></div>
<p>See? Isn&#8217;t this so much better? The only difference to your current work&#xFB02;ow is
that instead of <tt class="docutils literal">git pull</tt> you will run <tt class="docutils literal">git pull <span class="pre">&#8211;rebase</span></tt>.&nbsp;Easy!</p>

                <div class="section" id="the-modern-web-developer-and-open-source-licenses">
<h3>The modern web developer and open source&nbsp;licenses</h3>
<p>The world of open source is full of wonders. People write code for free and
make it available for free for anyone to use. If you write a quick little
program on the weekend, it&#8217;s usually because there is a need that has to be
&#xFB01;lled. There&#8217;s a repetitive task that you wish you didn&#8217;t have to do so you
write a short program to do it for&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Web development can be hard. You have to worry about your database, your
server-side code, your client-side templates and javascript and it all has to
magically work together. We web developers have created a ton of tools to help
us get the job done. And those of us who are really commited to the best and
most reliable software make what we create in our spare time available for
everyone else to use. We share the awesome idea we had in hopes that someone
had the same problem and we could help them solve it. Massive projects like
Django and Ruby on Rails come to mind. jQuery and Prototype. Fabric and
Capistrano. The list just goes&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>The world of open source is full of wonders. All of this is possible by
releasing our code under a license. And not just any license. If you were to
publish your code online without describing how it can be used, by default you
are reserving all the rights to yourself. Nobody else can legally use it. You
as the creator have the right and responsibility to decide how your code will
be&nbsp;used.</p>
<p>I was introduced to the world of open source by Linux and the <span class="caps">GNU</span> movement. For
the longest time, I would claim that the only true open source license is the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"><span class="caps">GPL</span></a>. It&#8217;s a great license. It ensures that your software will never be used
in a non-free way (free as in freedom). It works great for medium to large
scale pieces of software, such as the Linux kernel or git. The two are self
contained and don&#8217;t usually have any&nbsp;dependencies.</p>
<p>However, the more I moved from desktop software development towards developing
for the web, the more I found myself frustrated and confused by the <span class="caps">GPL</span>. If a
user downloads a web page generated by a <span class="caps">GPL</span>-covered web framework, do I need
to also make available to the user the code that generated the page? If I use
jQuery on my page (which is released under the <span class="caps">GPL</span>) and my scripts use it, do I
have to provide non-mini&#xFB01;ed versions of my scripts? Can I legally use a
<span class="caps">GPL</span>-covered web framework to build a website for client and not make the source
code&nbsp;available?</p>
<p>There are plenty more options to think about and my head starts to hurt every
time I try to make a sense of it&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>I believe that the General Public License is <em>unsuitable</em> for web-based
projects such as web frameworks, javascript libraries, etc. In a modern web
application, there are way too many moving parts created by different parties.
It&#8217;s the web developer&#8217;s job to &#xFB01;nd the best tools to get their job done. I
believe that the best tools available today are of the open source variety
(<span class="caps">MS</span> <span class="caps">SQL</span> server,&nbsp;anyone?).</p>
<p>I was reading Jeff Atwood&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/pick-a-license-any-license.html">article</a> on software licenses and became
convinced that I should abandon the <span class="caps">GPL</span> for my projects. After all, I want
people to use my software and making them try and understand the intricacies of
the legal language of the <span class="caps">GPL</span> is unnecessary. Starting today, I will make my
projects available under the terms of a more permissive license. My current
favorites&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license"><span class="caps">BSD</span></a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php"><span class="caps">MIT</span></a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/"><span class="caps">WTFPL</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>They are all short and easy to understand. Peoples&#8217; time is expensive, let&#8217;s
not waste&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>If you are a developer and you maintain a project that&#8217;s useful for making the
web a better place, I would ask that you consider using a permissive license
for your&nbsp;project.</p>
<p><strong>Update (2012-01-09):</strong> After reading Van Lindberg&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517960.do">book</a> on Open source
licenses, I have learned that the <span class="caps">WTFPL</span> isn&#8217;t a good idea. It doesn&#8217;t actually
do anything in terms of legal protection or&nbsp;warranty.</p>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="virtual-machines-for-django-developers">
<h3>Virtual machines for Django&nbsp;developers</h3>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> is a tool for building and distributing virtualized
development environments. It&#8217;s based on VirtualBox VMs. This article describes
how this Ruby tool can be useful to Django&nbsp;developers.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-vagrant">
<h4>Why&nbsp;vagrant?</h4>
<p>The modern web developer works on many different projects. Each project has a
unique set of requirements, dependencies and package versions needed for that
project to succeed. Keeping all of these libraries in check is dif&#xFB01;cult.
<tt class="docutils literal">virtualenv</tt> is a tool that creates isolated environments for Python
packages. Vagrant takes this approach a step further. You can virtualize the
entire&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>Just as each Django project will have a <tt class="docutils literal">requirements.txt</tt> &#xFB01;le which lists
the project&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal">pip</tt> dependencies, your project will now have a
<tt class="docutils literal">Vagrant&#xFB01;le</tt> and a <tt class="docutils literal">cookbooks</tt> directory. The <tt class="docutils literal">Vagrant&#xFB01;le</tt> describes
how the <span class="caps">VM</span> should be created and the <tt class="docutils literal">cookbooks</tt> directory contains
instructions on what packages to install. For example, in the <tt class="docutils literal">Vagrant&#xFB01;le</tt>
you will specify a <span class="caps">VM</span> which runs an Ubuntu server with <span class="caps">256MB</span> of <span class="caps">RAM</span> and your
<tt class="docutils literal">cookbooks</tt> directory will tell vagrant to install apache2, git, postgresql
and&nbsp;memcached.</p>
<p>Getting started with vagrant is&nbsp;simple.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-started">
<h4>Getting&nbsp;started</h4>
<p>vagrant is distributed as a Ruby gem and you can install it like&nbsp;so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">gem install vagrant</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Next, you will download a base box that I made for you. It&#8217;s an Ubuntu 10.10
server with minimal&nbsp;con&#xFB01;guration.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">vagrant box add vagrant-ubuntu http://honza.ca/downloads/vagrant-ubuntu.box</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This will take a while so you may want to get a&nbsp;beverage.</p>
<p>Next, you will create a directory that will hold your project and initialize it
for&nbsp;vagrant.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">cd ~/Code</span>
<span class="go">mkdir webapp</span>
<span class="go">cd webapp</span>
<span class="go">vagrant init vagrant-ubuntu</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This will create a <tt class="docutils literal">Vagrant&#xFB01;le</tt> in that&nbsp;directory.</p>
<p>And then&nbsp;run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">vagrant up</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to actually build and boot the environment. This might take a few&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<p>After this, your environment is running. Your environment is a headless
virtualbox instance.  You can <tt class="docutils literal">ssh</tt> into the box by&nbsp;running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">vagrant ssh</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You will notice that your project directory (<tt class="docutils literal">webapp</tt>) is mounted inside the
environment under <tt class="docutils literal">/vagrant</tt>. Any changes to either directory will affect the&nbsp;other.</p>
<p>You can shutdown your environment&nbsp;with</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">vagrant halt</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Destroy it&nbsp;with:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">vagrant destroy</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="provisioning">
<h4>Provisioning</h4>
<p>Next, you will install some packages into the <span class="caps">VM</span>. You will install some common
Django packages: PostreSQL, Apache, <span class="caps">WSGI</span>, memcached and&nbsp;git.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">cd ~/Code/webapp</span>
<span class="go">git clone git@github.com:honza/cookbooks.git</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This downloads all kinds of cookbooks ready for our use. We will create a
custom cookbook inside that directory where we will de&#xFB01;ne what packages we&nbsp;want:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">cd cookbooks</span>
<span class="go">mkdir webapp</span>
<span class="go">cd webapp</span>
<span class="go">mkdir recipes</span>
<span class="go">touch recipes/default.rb</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now open up the <tt class="docutils literal">default.rb</tt> &#xFB01;le and enter the&nbsp;following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">require_recipe</span> <span class="s2">&quot;postgresql::server&quot;</span>
<span class="n">require_recipe</span> <span class="s2">&quot;apache2&quot;</span>
<span class="n">include_recipe</span> <span class="s2">&quot;apache2::</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">node</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:django</span><span class="o">][</span><span class="ss">:web_server</span><span class="o">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>
<span class="n">require_recipe</span> <span class="s2">&quot;git&quot;</span>
<span class="n">require_recipe</span> <span class="s2">&quot;memcached&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And modify your <tt class="docutils literal">Vagrant&#xFB01;le</tt> to use the&nbsp;cookbooks:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="no">Vagrant</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="no">Con&#xFB01;g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">con&#xFB01;g</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">con&#xFB01;g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">box</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;vagrant-ubuntu&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">con&#xFB01;g</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">vm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">provision</span> <span class="ss">:chef_solo</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">chef</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="n">chef</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cookbooks_path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;cookbooks&quot;</span>
      <span class="n">chef</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_recipe</span> <span class="s2">&quot;webapp&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</pre></div>
<p>For the con&#xFB01;guration changes to take effect, you need to&nbsp;run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">vagrant reload</span>
</pre></div>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, that concludes our quick introduction to Vagrant. I hope you see how this
can be bene&#xFB01;cial and how simple it is to get&nbsp;started.</p>

            <title>Why you should be using CoffeeScript</title>

            <id>http://honza.ca/2011/04/why-you-should-be-using-coffeescript</id>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="why-you-should-be-using-coffeescript">
<h3>Why you should be using&nbsp;CoffeeScript</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard of CoffeeScript. Everyone is talking about it, it seems.
It&#8217;s a beautiful language with a simple syntax that you use to write
Javascript. CoffeeScript compiles to Javascript. Here is why I think you should
be using&nbsp;it:</p>
<div class="section" id="readability">
<h4>Readability</h4>
<p>CoffeeScript is designed to be beautiful and readable. There is no unnecessary
&#xFB02;uff. Less syntax boilerplate, fewer mistakes.&nbsp;Compare:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// regular javascript</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">author</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;William Shakespeare&quot;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="c1">// coffeescript</span>
<span class="nx">author</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;William Shakespeare&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Indentation is also important in CoffeeScript - just like in Python. This makes
closures and blocks easier to&nbsp;spot.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="valid-code">
<h4>Valid&nbsp;Code</h4>
<p>There are many different coding styles when it comes to writing Javascript. The
good thing about CoffeeScript is that the Javascript it generates is valid - it
passes <a class="reference external" href="http://www.javascriptlint.com/">Javascript Lint</a>. And if your code isn&#8217;t valid CoffeeScript, it
won&#8217;t compile. It&#8217;s a win-win. This is perhaps my favorite&nbsp;feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="easy-class-inheritance">
<h4>Easy class&nbsp;inheritance</h4>
<p>This is just great. It reminds me of Python and&nbsp;Ruby:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nx">Animal</span>
    <span class="nv">constructor: </span><span class="nf">(@name) -&gt;</span>

    <span class="nv">move: </span><span class="nf">(meters) -&gt;</span>
        <span class="nx">alert</span> <span class="nx">@name</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s">&quot; moved </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nx">meters</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s">m.&quot;</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nx">Dog</span> <span class="k">extends</span> <span class="nx">Animal</span>
    <span class="nv">move: </span><span class="o">-&gt;</span>
        <span class="nx">alert</span> <span class="s">&quot;Whoof...&quot;</span>
        <span class="k">super</span> <span class="mi">5</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Compiles to this in&nbsp;Javascript:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">Animal</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">Dog</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>Quite a difference, huh? Think how much time you&#8217;d need to understand each
version and make any changes required. In my mind, this encourages better code
organization and&nbsp;structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="node-js-awesomeness">
<h4>Node.js&nbsp;awesomeness</h4>
<p>CoffeeScript comes with a Node.js utility, <tt class="docutils literal">coffee</tt>. You can write your
Node.js code in CoffeeScript and run it with <tt class="docutils literal">coffee &#xFB01;le.js</tt>. The utility
wraps the CoffeeScript compiler and the <tt class="docutils literal">node</tt> executable. This way, you can
whip up a quick server in no time.&nbsp;Genius.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="easy-debugging">
<h4>Easy&nbsp;debugging</h4>
<p>With tools like <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/">Google Web Toolkit</a>, your code compiles to <em>mini&#xFB01;ed</em>
javascript. Non-mini&#xFB01;ed code is obviously easier (possible?) to read and&nbsp;debug.</p>

<h3>The latest greatest&nbsp;technology</h3>
<p>I just found an interesting quote by <a class="reference external" href="http://mir.aculo.us/">Thomas Fuchs</a>, the creator of
script.aculo.us and a core member of the Prototype team. The quote is from his
<a class="reference external" href="http://thomas.fuchs.usesthis.com/">Setup</a>&nbsp;interview:</p>
<blockquote>
For computer programmers, especially if you&#8217;re self-employed, there&#8217;s no
excuse whatsoever not to get the latest and greatest. You don&#8217;t really have
other expenses anyway, it&#8217;s tax-deductible and, most importantly, it will
make you happy and more productive if you know that you&#8217;re using the best
available tools.</blockquote>

<h3>JSLint syntax checker for&nbsp;vim</h3>
<p>Douglas Crockford&#8217;s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.jslint.com/">JSLint</a> script is almost a golden standard when it comes
to checking the syntax and general sanity of your javascript &#xFB01;les. Being lazy
by nature, I got tired of copying and pasting my code into the web&nbsp;form.</p>
<p>I wanted to be able to run the JSLint tool from the command line. JSLint itself
is written in javascript. It&#8217;s a 6000-line beast. How do you run a javascript
library as a command line utility? The answer is <a class="reference external" href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote a quick little script that takes a single argument (your &#xFB01;le) and runs
JSLint over it, printing any errors to the console. I call it <tt class="docutils literal">jslintnode.js</tt>
and the code is on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/honza/jslintnode.js">Github</a>.</p>
<p>Well, checking my &#xFB01;les from the command line is certainly better than using
the web interface. But I still have to run it over and over. As you may know,
I&#8217;m fanatical <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vim.org">vim</a> user. There is a cool plugin called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic">syntastic</a> which
runs through the &#xFB01;le you are editing each time you save it. It puts little
<tt class="docutils literal">&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt> characters next to the line you are editing which tells you that you
screwed up and need to &#xFB01;x that&nbsp;line.</p>
<p>However, by default, syntastic uses the <tt class="docutils literal">jsl</tt> utility to check javascript
&#xFB01;les. With a little bit of work, you can modify the original script to use our
<tt class="docutils literal">jslintnode.js</tt> utility.</p>
<p>Go into the <tt class="docutils literal">/syntax_checkers/</tt> directory and open up the <tt class="docutils literal">javascript.vim</tt>
&#xFB01;le.</p>
<p>Change this&nbsp;line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">!</span>executable<span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;jsl&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">!</span>executable<span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;jslintnode.js&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And replace the body of the <tt class="docutils literal">SyntaxCheckers_javascript_GetLocList()</tt> function
with the&nbsp;following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">let</span> <span class="nb">makeprg</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;jslintnode.js &quot;</span>.shellescape<span class="p">(</span>expand<span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;%&#39;</span><span class="p">))</span>
<span class="k">let</span> <span class="nb">errorformat</span><span class="p">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;%W%f(%l): lint warning: %m,%-Z%p^,%W%f(%l): warning: %m,%-Z%p^,%E%f(%l): SyntaxError: %m,%-Z%p^,%-G&#39;</span>
<span class="k">return</span> SyntasticMake<span class="p">(</span>{ <span class="s1">&#39;makeprg&#39;</span>: <span class="nb">makeprg</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;errorformat&#39;</span>: <span class="nb">errorformat</span> }<span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Save and restart&nbsp;vim.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it. Now as you&#8217;re editing any javascript &#xFB01;les you will get instant
feedback as to the quality of your code as judged by JSLint. And remember that
<em>JSLint will hurt your feelings</em>.</p>

                <div class="section" id="the-irrationality-of-being-an-apple-fanboy">
<h3>The Irrationality of Being an Apple&nbsp;Fanboy</h3>
<p>It continues to amaze me how much people devote themselves to Apple products.
Every time the fruit company releases a new product, people line in front of
the store for days in hopes of being one of the &#xFB01;rst blessed people who get to
touch the shiny new toy. The Oatmeal has an awesome <a class="reference external" href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/apple">comic</a> about
this. Being all crazy and sleeping on the sidewalk aside, let&#8217;s look at more of
a down-to-earth&nbsp;example.</p>
<p>Being a geek and all, I get asked rather often if I would recommend someone
buys a Mac laptop. While I wholeheartadly agree that the Unix-like qualities of
Mac <span class="caps">OSX</span> are in&#xFB01;nitely superior to the (non) qualities of the Windows kernel, I
cannot recommend to my friends that they buy a laptop with an apple on&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Here is&nbsp;why.</p>
<p>I went on the <cite>FutureShop</cite> website to see what brand new laptops cost these
days and how powerful they&nbsp;are.</p>
<p>First, I looked up the cheapest 15&#8217; <a class="reference external" href="http://www.futureshop.ca/en-CA/product/apple-apple-macbook-pro-15-4-intel-core-i5-2-53ghz-laptop-english-mc372ll-a/10144050.aspx?path=d60135943742891f1c13c3119725be53en02">Macbook Pro</a>. Here are the&nbsp;specs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Intel Core i5&nbsp;2.53GHz</li>
<li><span class="caps">4GB</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">RAM</span></li>
<li><span class="caps">500GB</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">HDD</span></li>
<li>Intel <span class="caps">HD</span> Graphics&nbsp;Card</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$1,699.95</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, I looked for a solid laptop that could compete with the Macbook Pro. I
didn&#8217;t want to compare it to laptops of questionable quality like those made by
Acer or <span class="caps">HP</span>. I went for a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.futureshop.ca/en-CA/product/sony-sony-vaio-15-5-intel-core-i5-460m-laptop-vpceb37fdw-white-vpceb37fdw/10156213.aspx?path=b3cc400131894855a015719f00cd1728en02">Sony Vaio</a>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Intel Core i5&nbsp;2.53GHz</li>
<li><span class="caps">4GB</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">RAM</span></li>
<li><span class="caps">500GB</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">HDD</span></li>
<li>Intel <span class="caps">HD</span> Graphics&nbsp;Card</li>
<li>Price:&nbsp;$899</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you will have noticed that the two computers have the exact same specs.
However, the Macbook is almost <em>double</em> the price. I say, buy the Vaio and
install Ubuntu on it. Rock solid laptop with a rock solid <span class="caps">OS</span>. You can also buy
your wife a netbook or an iPad with the money you&nbsp;save.</p>
<p>Let the &#xFB02;aming&nbsp;begin.</p>

                <div class="section" id="ways-github-has-changed-the-open-source-world">
<h3>7 ways Github has changed the open source&nbsp;world</h3>
<p>As the guys at <a class="reference external" href="http://thechangelog.com">the changelog</a> say, the world of open source is changing fast
and you have to keep up. I believe that Github has been very in&#xFB02;uential when
it comes to making open source more accessible. How has Github changed the
world of open&nbsp;source?</p>
<div class="section" id="force-projects-to-include-a-good-readme">
<h4>Force projects to include a good&nbsp;<span class="caps">README</span></h4>
<p>Apart from the directory structure and &#xFB01;les, the most prominent element on the
page is your <span class="caps">README</span> &#xFB01;le. If you don&#8217;t have one, the page looks kind of weird. As
an administrator, if you don&#8217;t add a <span class="caps">README</span> &#xFB01;le, Github will start yelling at&nbsp;you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uni&#xFB01;ed-place-for-all-your-projects">
<h4>Uni&#xFB01;ed place for all your&nbsp;projects</h4>
<p>When I come across a cool project, I like to see what other stuff the author
has been hacking on. The best example I think is <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/tpope">tpope</a> who is a famous
vim plugin creator. When you go to his pro&#xFB01;le page on Github, you can see all
of the plugins he has ever written and&nbsp;published.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-discussions">
<h4>Code&nbsp;discussions</h4>
<p>Yes, you can discuss the project on <span class="caps">IRC</span> or on mailing lists. Those aren&#8217;t
exactly user friendly, and it&#8217;s hard to discuss code that way. Github makes it
easy for you to submit a pull request and have others comment on your&nbsp;code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="publish-your-hacks-with-ease">
<h4>Publish your hacks with&nbsp;ease</h4>
<p>Did you just write a patch that greatly improves an existing project? Fork it
and publish it in minutes. If you notify the original project, you can get
helpful feedback on your hacks. This encourages people to publish their code
even if it&#8217;s never merged into the original&nbsp;project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="judge-how-active-a-project-is">
<h4>Judge how active a project&nbsp;is</h4>
<p>Github makes it easy to quickly look through a project&#8217;s history to see how
active it is. In no time, you can tell how many people commit to it and how
often. Also, the number of watchers/forks in the corner gives you a pretty good
idea of how many people are actually using the project. This is possibly my
favorite feature. Open source developers don&#8217;t need to waste their time
exploring libraries that aren&#8217;t&nbsp;maintained.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discover-new-projects">
<h4>Discover new&nbsp;projects</h4>
<p>Smart people come up with clever things all the time. If they share their code
on Github, you can &#xFB01;nd it in the Explore Github section. I can&#8217;t remember how
many times I&#8217;ve discovered a cool project this way. My favorite example is
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script">CoffeeScript</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="follow-the-development-of-your-favorite-projects">
<h4>Follow the development of your favorite&nbsp;projects</h4>
<p>When you &#xFB01;rst log in, you are presented with a list of changes that were made
to the projects you follow. This projects has a new release, this bug was
&#xFB01;xed. etc.&nbsp;Invaluable.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Any favorite features of&nbsp;Github?</p>

                <div class="section" id="how-to-convert-vim-colorschemes-to-pygments-themes">
<h3>How To Convert Vim Colorschemes To Pygments&nbsp;Themes</h3>
<p>Recently, I have grown to love <a class="reference external" href="http://pygments.org">Pygments</a>. It gives you syntax
highlighting in the browser without heavy Javascript &#xFB01;les. It supports just
about any programming language on the planet and it&#8217;s just plain awesome. The
only thing that it&#8217;s lacking is good color schemes. It comes with a dozen
themes that will certainly do the trick, but if you&#8217;re used to looking at
pretty code in your favorite editor, the code examples on your website will
look a little&nbsp;dull.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to go out on a limb here and assume you have a favorite colorscheme.
I found a script that will turn a vim colorscheme into a Pygments theme. It
didn&#8217;t work perfectly out of the box so I patched it. You can download it
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/honza/vim2pygments">here</a>. Copy your vim colorscheme to the same directory as the script and run
it like&nbsp;so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> python vim2pygments.py molokai.vim &gt; molokai.py
</pre></div>
<p>This will produce a Python &#xFB01;le containing a simple style class that Pygments
can use. Next step is to download&nbsp;Pygments:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> hg clone http://dev.pocoo.org/hg/pygments-main pygments
</pre></div>
<p>And then you will install your new&nbsp;theme:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> <span class="nb">cd </span>pygments
<span class="gp">$</span> cp ../molokai.py pygments/styles/molokai.py
</pre></div>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, now for the fun part. We will use Pygments to generate the <span class="caps">CSS</span> &#xFB01;le that
you will then use on your&nbsp;website:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">$</span> ./pygmentize -S molokai -f html -a .highlight &gt; molokai.css
</pre></div>
<p>If you are a TextMate user, you might be able to get your favorite theme done,
too. A lot of popular Vim colorschemes are inspired by TextMate. Sunburst,
mustang and idle &#xFB01;ngers come to mind. Just &#xFB01;nd a Vim version and you&#8217;re good
to&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s&nbsp;it!</p>

<h3>Why Nokia chose Windows over&nbsp;Android</h3>
<p>Today, we have all heard about the new deal struck between Nokia and Microsoft.
It is a major change in Nokia&#8217;s strategy which will without a doubt affect the
smartphone&nbsp;market.</p>
<p>A few month ago, the Executive Vice President of Nokia <a class="reference external" href="http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/09/22/nokia-evp-anssi-vanjoki-switching-to-android-is-like-peeing-in-your-pants-for-warmth/">announced</a> that
switching to Android is like peeing in your boots for warmth. Well, let me say
this: if switching to Android is like peeing in your boots, switching to
Windows is like shitting your&nbsp;pants.</p>
<p>Perhaps, Nokia liked the latter&nbsp;better.</p>

<h3>How My Website&nbsp;Works</h3>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard of static site generators like Jekyll (Ruby) or Hyde
(Python). The bene&#xFB01;ts are obvious - your site is hosted on a cheap shared
hosting and it can easily survive the Digg/Slashdot/Reddit effect. There is no
database latency - the browser requests a &#xFB01;le on the server and gets it back&nbsp;immediately.</p>
<div class="section" id="update-2011-02-27">
<h4>Update&nbsp;(2011-02-27):</h4>
<p>While I still use a static generator to power my site, it&#8217;s not a different
engine. I got tired of launching a django server just to write a post. I wrote
a new static site generator called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/honza/socrates">Socrates</a>. Each post is now a separate
&#xFB01;le written in Markdown. Socrates then runs through those &#xFB01;les and creates a
site for me. I&#8217;m still using django templates. What follows is the original&nbsp;post.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="django">
<h4>django</h4>
<p>The site is a simple django blog. There is nothing really of note when it comes
to django-speci&#xFB01;c coding. I run the django server locally when I&#8217;m editing or
adding articles. It provides a nice <span class="caps">UI</span>. It also lets me easily preview the site
without generating&nbsp;anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="static-generator">
<h4>static&nbsp;generator</h4>
<p>When I&#8217;m happy with the state of the website and want to publish it, I run the
static generator. It&#8217;s contained in the <tt class="docutils literal">generate.py</tt> &#xFB01;le. It runs through
all possible urls and for each one it generates a static &#xFB01;le. Each &#xFB01;le is a
complete <span class="caps">HTML</span> page that the user&#8217;s browser will download. The folder structure
is as&nbsp;follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>/2010/
    /02/
        post-one.html
        post-two.html
/2011/
    ..
        ..
/about/
    index.html
index.html
/page/
    /2/
        index.html
/category/
    /android/
        index.html
    /code/
        index.html
    ..
</pre></div>
<p>You get the idea. This way, with an <tt class="docutils literal">.htaccess</tt> &#xFB01;le we can have the
following <span class="caps">URL</span>&nbsp;structure:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>/2010/02/post-one/
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ftp-deploy-script">
<h4><span class="caps">FTP</span> deploy&nbsp;script</h4>
<p>And the &#xFB01;nal piece is the <tt class="docutils literal">deploy.py</tt> script. It looks at the deploy
directory, and with a little help from git, it &#xFB01;gures out what &#xFB01;les were
changed since the last deploy. It then takes those &#xFB01;les and throws them up on
the server. A normal shared&nbsp;hosting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>You can check out the code on <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/honza/honza.github.com">Github</a>.</p>

<h3>Android Development&nbsp;disappointments</h3>
<p>The Android platform is the latest buzz in the smartphone world. I have
previously written on why I prefer Android over iPhone. In this article, we
will talk a little bit about what it&#8217;s like to develop native applications for&nbsp;Android.</p>
<p>Android <span class="caps">SDK</span> uses Java. I know Java but it&#8217;s not my favorite. After working with
Python and Django for months, going back to Java isn&#8217;t exactly easy. But it&#8217;s
not undoable&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>Being from the Czech republic, I thought I would try to target the Czech
market. Android is starting to get really big over there. I decided to write a
simple news reader application for one of the leading news portals called iDnes
(&#8220;eToday&#8221;). The application downloads an <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed, parses it and displays a
list of news articles to the user. The user has the option to choose their
topic, and to manually refresh the application to get new&nbsp;articles.</p>
<p>Not very complicated at all. It took me a few evenings to put it together. The
development process was quite fun. The Android <span class="caps">SDK</span> integration into Eclipse is
awesome. It tells you when you have to implement additional methods, or
automatically adds your imports when it&#8217;s needed. As part of the <span class="caps">SDK</span>, you get a
simulator for all kinds of versions of Android (from 1.5 to 2.2). This way, you
can test your application on various versions of the&nbsp;<span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
<p>I read all the articles on packaging and distributing. I made sure my
application was backwards compatible. I tried to follow their guidelines for
app icons as much as I could (well, I suck at graphic design). I exported the
applications, signed it, aligned it and uploaded it to the Android&nbsp;Market.</p>
<p>I was excited. I did it. I published my &#xFB01;rst Android applications. But then
came the&nbsp;disappointment.</p>
<p>My app started to get a lot of bad comments in the market. People complained
that the application didn&#8217;t do anything, and they couldn&#8217;t read any news, etc.
I didn&#8217;t come across any errors like that during testing. If the applications
doesn&#8217;t have internet, it will tell the user it doesn&#8217;t have internet. If there
is a problem, it will let them&nbsp;know.</p>
<p>As a developer and author, I feel there is no way for me to receive helpful
information about the errors the users are getting when they are interacting
with the&nbsp;application.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, that&#8217;s it. If you have any comments or suggestions, do let me know in the&nbsp;comments.</p>

<h3>Apple Finally Catches Up To&nbsp;Linux</h3>
<p>Apple recently unveiled their newest venture. It&#8217;s called the App Store, and
I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard of it. It&#8217;s a place on your computer that lets you
download and discover new applications. Just like the package manager on most
Linux&nbsp;distributions.</p>
<p>Except Linux has had &#8216;app stores&#8217; for years. Welcome to 21st century computing,&nbsp;Apple.</p>

<h3>How Money Is Made&nbsp;Online</h3>
<p>My friends of the non-geek type often ask me how companies like Facebook can
make so much money and provide their service for free at the same time. Here is
a quick example of how you can make money&nbsp;online.</p>
<p>Warning: this is a not a get rich quick scheme. I&#8217;m not going teach you how to
make millions working for Google from&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>I recently started following John Gruber&#8217;s blog <a class="reference external" href="http://daring&#xFB01;reball.net/">Darring Fireball</a>. This
gentleman seems to be rather in&#xFB02;uential in the hacker community. On the
website, he says that there are more than 400,000 subscribers that frequently
read his blog. In the world of Internet publishing, this is a great deal of
exposure. Not very many people get this much&nbsp;attention.</p>
<p>If you browse through the site, you will soon notice that you can sponsor John
to write more articles. You can pay him $5,000/month - in return, a small
banner with your company&#8217;s advertising graphics will be displayed in a
prominent place on John&#8217;s blog for that month. You will get millions of people
every month looking at your ad for just&nbsp;$5,000/month.</p>
<p>Writing interesting articles about the web is a full-time job for&nbsp;John.</p>

<h3>Why I Chose&nbsp;Android</h3>
<p>Recently, we have heard that the Android operating system has the largest
market share in the <span class="caps">US</span>, and is set to take over the whole world. Personally, I
chose Android long before it was this popular.&nbsp;Why?</p>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>I won&#8217;t bore you with my personal history, but I&#8217;d like to say a few things.
I&#8217;m a programmer and like to tweet things. If there isn&#8217;t an application that
does the job, I write it myself. Couple years ago, I was given the then amazing
iPhone 3G. I was thrilled. Everyone wanted one, and I had&nbsp;it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="motorola-droid">
<h4>Motorola&nbsp;Droid</h4>
<p>I sold the iPhone, and bought a Motorola Droid. Why? It&#8217;s actually pretty
simple. I don&#8217;t like closed systems. If you want to develop an application for
the iPhone, you have to buy an Apple computer. You have to use XCode, the
objective-C <span class="caps">IDE</span>. And only after your application gets approved, you can use it
on your phone. I don&#8217;t like the idea of spending an upwards of $1,000 to get an
underpowered machine just to be able to write an&nbsp;app.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="blackberry">
<h4>Blackberry</h4>
<p>After deciding, I wanted to get off the iPhone train, I started looking around
for a new smartphone. The &#xFB01;rst choice was Blackberry. A serious Canadian
company, business-class smartphones, good prices, &#8230; What&#8217;s not to like? Well,
it turns out that you need Microsoft Windows in order to properly develop and
test your Blackberry application. Being an avid Linux user, I very much
disliked the idea of going back to Windows just because of&nbsp;Blackberry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enter-android">
<h4>Enter&nbsp;Android</h4>
<p>Android was my next choice. I browsed over to the developers&#8217; website to see if
I can make apps for this platform. When I saw that Windows, Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> and Linux
were supported, I almost cried for joy! I learned that Android runs on the
Linux kernel, apps are written in Java using the open source&nbsp;<span class="caps">SDK</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="google">
<h4>Google</h4>
<p>Yes, Google is behind this whole thing. You may not exactly care unless you use
their services. The integration of Google services into Android is phenomenal.
When you &#xFB01;rst turn on your device, you are asked to enter your Google account
information, and the device takes care of the rest. Your email, contacts,
calendar, Google Talk, etc. are set up automatically.&nbsp;Genius.</p>

            <content type="html">
                <div class="section" id="how-to-use-twitter-oauth-on-android">
<h3>How To Use Twitter OAuth On&nbsp;Android</h3>
<p>If you are developing an application for the Android platform, and you need to
interact with the Twitter <span class="caps">API</span>, you now have to use OAuth to authenticate the
user. In this article, we will have a look on how you can do&nbsp;that.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-is-oauth">
<h4>What is&nbsp;OAuth?</h4>
<p>OAuth is a way of accessing a user&#8217;s data (e.g. tweets) without asking for the
user&#8217;s username and password. Your application opens the Twitter website which
will ask the user if they want to allow you to access their data. If they do,
they are taken back to the application and can start using it. You can &#xFB01;nd
more about OAuth all over the&nbsp;web.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prerequisites">
<h4>Prerequisites</h4>
<p>There are a couple of .jars that you will need for this to&nbsp;work.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>signpost-commonshttp4-1.2.1.1.jar</li>
<li>signpost-core-1.2.1.1.jar</li>
</ul>
<p>You can download them <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kaeppler/signpost">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basic-activity">
<h4>Basic&nbsp;Activity</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s say we have an activity running where the user can start the
authentication process. There is nothing special about this activity, except
for some text and a button. When the user clicks the button, the OAuth process
will be started. From the button&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal">onClickListener()</tt> we will call the
<tt class="docutils literal">startOAuth()</tt> method of our&nbsp;activity.</p>
<p>We will add a few attributes to our activity. Let&#8217;s call the activity&nbsp;Main.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Main</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="n">Activity</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="n">CommonsHttpOAuthConsumer</span> <span class="n">httpOauthConsumer</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="n">OAuthProvider</span> <span class="n">httpOauthprovider</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">&#xFB01;nal</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">consumerKey</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;abc&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">&#xFB01;nal</span> <span class="kd">static</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">consumerSecret</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;abc&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">&#xFB01;nal</span> <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n"><span class="caps">CALLBACKURL</span></span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;app://twitter&quot;</span><span class="o">;</span>

    <span class="nd">@Override</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">onCreate</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Bundle</span> <span class="n">savedInstanceState</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
        <span class="kd">super</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">onCreate</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">savedInstanceState</span><span class="o">);</span>
        <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">consumerKey</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">consumerSecret</tt> will store your app&#8217;s unique keys that
you will get from Twitter. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="caps">CALLBACK</span></tt> is a little different. This is used
when the application is authorized on the web, and the control is returned back
to the Main activity. For the mobile browser to be able to call the application
and tell it that the OAuth business has gone well, it needs a call back. Both
app and twitter can be exchanged for anything&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s have a look at the <tt class="docutils literal">startOAuth()</tt> method.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">try</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">httpOauthConsumer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">CommonsHttpOAuthConsumer</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">consumerKey</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">consumerSecret</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="n">httpOauthprovider</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">DefaultOAuthProvider</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;http://twitter.com/oauth/request_token&quot;</span><span class="o">,</span>

                                            <span class="s">&quot;http://twitter.com/oauth/authorize&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
    <span class="n">String</span> <span class="n">authUrl</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">httpOauthprovider</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">retrieveRequestToken</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">httpOauthConsumer</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n"><span class="caps">CALLBACKURL</span></span><span class="o">);</span>

<span class="o">}</span> <span class="k">catch</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Exception</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Here we create the necessary OAuth objects which will in turn generate the
unique authenticating <span class="caps">URL</span>. Once we have the <span class="caps">URL</span> we open the browser and point
it to that <span class="caps">URL</span>. The user will be presented with a dialog asking them to allow
or to deny your application&nbsp;access.</p>
<p>In order for our activity to be able to receive the callback, we need to add a
few things the Android manifest &#xFB01;le. Change the applications de&#xFB01;nition to the&nbsp;following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nt">&lt;activity</span> <span class="na">android:name=</span><span class="s">&quot;Main&quot;</span> <span class="na">android:launchMode=</span><span class="s">&quot;singleInstance&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;intent-&#xFB01;lter&gt;</span>
         <span class="nt">&lt;action</span> <span class="na">android:name=</span><span class="s">&quot;android.intent.action.<span class="caps">VIEW</span>&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
         <span class="nt">&lt;category</span> <span class="na">android:name=</span><span class="s">&quot;android.intent.category.<span class="caps">DEFAULT</span>&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;category</span> <span class="na">android:name=</span><span class="s">&quot;android.intent.category.<span class="caps">BROWSABLE</span>&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;data</span> <span class="na">android:scheme=</span><span class="s">&quot;app&quot;</span> <span class="na">android:host=</span><span class="s">&quot;twitter&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/intent-&#xFB01;lter&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/activity&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Note that if you changed the app and twitter in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="caps">CALLBACK</span></tt> variable
above, you will need to make sure that the change is re&#xFB02;ected here. This
basically allows the activity to receive data from a foreign source - our&nbsp;browser.</p>
<p>Now we need to catch the callback and handle it. We do that by overriding the
<tt class="docutils literal">onNewIntent()</tt> method of our Main&nbsp;activity.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nd">@Override</span>
<span class="kd">protected</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">onNewIntent</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Intent</span> <span class="n">intent</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<h3>Posterous-style Blogging On App&nbsp;Engine</h3>
<p>Posterous has been getting a lot of attention lately. Its simplicity appeals to
a wide range of users and more and more users are switching over from other
well-established blogging platforms such as Blogger or WordPress. In this
article, we will have a look at how you can replicate the Posterous
functionality on App&nbsp;Engine.</p>
<p>In case you don&#8217;t know what Posterous is, it&#8217;s very simple. It&#8217;s a blogging
tool like Google&#8217;s Bloggeror Wordpress.com. What makes it different from the
other services is its ridiculous simplicity. With Posterous, you don&#8217;t need to
create an account. That&#8217;s because you create new posts by emailing your post to
Posterous. It creates links for you, images sent as attachments will be
transformed into galleries,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>I like Posterous, but my website has a lot of custom programming on the
back-end so I&#8217;m very hesitant to switch over. And besides, I like to know how
things work behind the scenes. I thought it might be fun to create a system
similar to Posterous&#8217; for my own blog which is, of course, hosted on App&nbsp;Engine.</p>
<p>Here is what we are going to do. I want to be able to send an email to my own
blog and have it turn it into a post and publish it to the&nbsp;blog.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, let&#8217;s start with the post&nbsp;model:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Post</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">StringProperty</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">body</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">TextProperty</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">added</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">DateTimeProperty</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">auto_now_add</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">author</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">db</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">StringProperty</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Very straight forward. You have your title, body, author and when the post was&nbsp;published.</p>
<p>In order to enable incoming email, you need to add a couple of lines of code to
your <tt class="docutils literal">app.yaml</tt> &#xFB01;le. In addition to your regular handlers, add the&nbsp;following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="l-Scalar-Plain">inbound_services</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
<span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">mail</span>

<span class="l-Scalar-Plain">handlers</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
<span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">url</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">/_ah/mail/.+</span>
  <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">script</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">main.py</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The &#xFB01;rst line enables incoming email for your application. The second part is
the important part. On App Engine, an incoming email message is processed as a
<span class="caps">HTTP</span> <span class="caps">POST</span> request. Since it&#8217;s a regular <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request, we will need a handler
for it in the <tt class="docutils literal">app.yaml</tt> &#xFB01;le. You have several options here. You can create
a catch-all handler for all incoming email addresses (like I&#8217;ve done above), or
create seperate handlers for different&nbsp;addresses.</p>
<p>The email address that we will use is in the following format:
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:your_string&#64;appid.appspotmail.com">your_string&#64;appid.appspotmail.com</a>. You should substitute the appid with your
app&#8217;s <span class="caps">ID</span>. The string before the &#8216;&#64;&#8217; symbol can be set to anything you&nbsp;want.</p>
<p>With this out of the way, we are ready to write the actual email handler. This
will go into your <tt class="docutils literal">main.py</tt> &#xFB01;le which you de&#xFB01;ned in the <tt class="docutils literal">app.yaml</tt>.</p>
<p>First, some&nbsp;imports:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">email</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">google.appengine.ext.webapp.mail_handlers</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">InboundMailHandler</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Then, you add the following to the list of <span class="caps">URL</span> mappings in the instantiation of
the application&nbsp;class.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">application</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">webapp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">WSGIApplication</span><span class="p">([</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Index</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">EmailHandler</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mapping</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="p">],</span> <span class="n">debug</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Here EmailHandler is the request handler class that will handle the incoming
email. The <tt class="docutils literal">mapping()</tt> method will map all of the addresses and send all of
them to this handler class. It&#8217;s just a convenience method, no magic&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Now, &#xFB01;nally, onto the actual&nbsp;handler:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">EmailHandler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">InboundMailHandler</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">receive</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">mail_message</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">post</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Post</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">title</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">mail_message</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">subject</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">content_type</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">body</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">mail_message</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bodies</span><span class="p">():</span>
            <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">body</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">body</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">decode</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">author</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&#39;John Smith&#39;</span>
        <span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">put</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>This is actually very simple. The incoming email message is saved in the
<tt class="docutils literal">mail_message</tt> variable and you can access all of the usual email metadata as
its properties (e.g. mail_message.sender). So, we create a new post, take the
email&#8217;s subject and set it as the post&#8217;s title. The <tt class="docutils literal">bodies()</tt> method
extracts the body of the email and the <tt class="docutils literal">decode()</tt> function will decode the
actual body. Then we set the author and save the post in the&nbsp;datastore.</p>
<p>Often you will want to include a link in your post, or create a list. This is
easily accomplished with <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags. However, <span class="caps">HTML</span> tags are a pain, so you might
want to use something like&nbsp;Markdown.</p>
<p>Adding markdown support is super easy. Download the Python
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/">Markdown library</a> and put the <tt class="docutils literal">markdown2.py</tt> &#xFB01;le in your app&#8217;s root
directory. Then import it in your <tt class="docutils literal">main.py</tt> &#xFB01;le.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">markdown2</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And change the following&nbsp;line:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">body</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">body</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">decode</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>to&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">post</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">body</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">markdown2</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">markdown</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">body</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">decode</span><span class="p">())</span>
</pre></div>
<p>And that&#8217;s&nbsp;it!</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>This is a very simple yet effective technique and it will allow you to create
post from anywhere. I hope you&#8217;ve enjoyed the post. Let me know if you have any
suggestions on how to improve&nbsp;it.</p>

<h3>Twitter Success Story - Hurricane&nbsp;Bill</h3>
<p>Beginners often &#xFB01;nd Twitter very confusing and useless. I think it&#8217;s because
they come to it with some preconceived ideas, and when Twitter doesn&#8217;t &#xFB01;t
their model they get frustrated. This series is meant to show why Twitter is so
useful and how it&#8217;s different from other social&nbsp;networks.</p>
<p>My family and I live in the city of Aberdeen in Scotland. My wife is originally
from Halifax, Canada where her parents still live. In August of last year,
there was a hurricane threat to the Halifax area. The hurricane was slowly
making its way up the coast towards Halifax, and was to strike the city around
8:<span class="caps">00AM</span> on a Sunday morning. Naturally, we were in touch with my in-laws and
kept checking news sites for&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p>However, as you might expect the news companies were closed (or at least on
limited staff) on that Sunday morning. We googled and googled and couldn&#8217;t &#xFB01;nd
any updates on the hurricane. Did it hit the city? Is it serious? Has
electricity been cut&nbsp;off?</p>
<p>Twitter is a source of real-time information. With the right query, you can get
updates and news just about anything. So, I searched for &#8220;hurricane bill
halifax&#8221; and just watched the tweets come in. At &#xFB01;rst, there wasn&#8217;t much. But
as time went by, people started talking about the hurricane. Some were saying
that the sky is a bit darker, some were seeing a little rain, etc. I even found
one user who actually went to the Halifax harbour to watch the hurricane come
in. He was posting images from his cell phone to show us what the weather was&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>Thanks to Twitter we were able to follow the development of the hurricane
almost minute by minute. In the end, there wasn&#8217;t much of hurricane after all.
By the time it got to Halifax, it had reduced to a mere&nbsp;storm.</p>
