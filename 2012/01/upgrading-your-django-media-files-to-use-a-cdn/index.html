<article>
  <p>I was using <a href="http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-filebrowser/en/latest/">django-filebrowser</a> on a project and my Rackspace VM quickly ran
out of disk space. Since the site isn&rsquo;t getting much traffic at all, I didn&rsquo;t
want to pay extra for a bigger VM. Instead, I decided to move all of the user
uploaded media to <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud%5Fhosting%5Fproducts/files/">Rackspace Cloudfiles</a>. It&rsquo;s super cheap and they have a
nice API.</p>
<p>Now, the challenge was to make the transition from a filebrowser-based system.
First of all, I knew I was going to use <a href="http://django-storages.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">django-storages</a> as the new storage
class for my class. I played around with it on the side and it worked like a
charm.</p>
<p>Next, I wrote a quick little Python script to upload all of the files to
Cloudfiles. Since the filenames didn&rsquo;t change at all, I could just write a
South migration that would strip the <code>/uploads</code> part and be done with it.</p>
<p>I had a look at the Django documentation to see what exactly a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/models/fields/#filefield">FileField</a> was.
It turns out it takes a Django <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/files/file/#django.core.files.File">File</a> object which in turn is a thin wrapper
around the Python built-in file object. This didn&rsquo;t sound exactly easy to do. I
would have to open a remote file with Python&rsquo;s <code>open('file.mp3')</code> and have
Django inspect it for size and file type. This is clunky at best if you
remember that this will have to live in a South migration.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is the fact that filebrowser&rsquo;s model field is a subclass of
<code>CharField</code> and has no special file-related properties or methods.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t use the <code>DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS</code> setting because filebrowser will
start yelling at you. Instead, you specify the storage class right in the new
model field.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#f92672">from</span> storages.backends.mosso <span style="color:#f92672">import</span> cloudfiles_upload_to, CloudFilesStorage
cloudfiles_storage <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> CloudFilesStorage()

<span style="color:#66d9ef">class</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">Item</span>(models<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>Model):
    old_field <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> FileBrowseField(max_length<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">500</span>, blank<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>True)
    new_field <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> models<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>FileField(upload_to<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>cloudfiles_upload_to,
            storage<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>cloudfiles_storage, default<span style="color:#f92672">=</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;&#39;</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Now you can go and write your migration and Django won&rsquo;t yell at you. Now we go
back to the problem outlined above. How do you create an instance of <code>File</code>
to pass to <code>item.new_field</code>.</p>
<p>After hours of reading the source and debugging, I realized that you can simply
pass in the filename as a string and the storage class will do the right thing.
It&rsquo;s actually really simple and painless. Your data migration might look
something like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> item <span style="color:#f92672">in</span> orm<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>Item<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>objects<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>all():
    item<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>new_field <span style="color:#f92672">=</span> os<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>path<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>basename(item<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>old_field<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>url)
    item<span style="color:#f92672">.</span>save()
</code></pre></div><p>So, I was already somewhat overjoyed that this would in fact be easy and then I
discovered that the change from filebrowser to django-storages doesn&rsquo;t require
a schema migration. This means that if your file names are the same there is no
database change needed at all. How cool is that?</p>
