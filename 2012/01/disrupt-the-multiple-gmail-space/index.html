  <p>We all know that Gmail is the best email provider out there. It&rsquo;s in the
browser, it&rsquo;s all ajaxy, you never delete anything, your emails are
cleverly organized into conversations, you know the drill&hellip;</p>
<p>But have you ever tried to use more than one account at a time? It&rsquo;s horribly
broken. Let&rsquo;s have a look at your options&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="multiple-sign-in">Multiple sign-in</h2>
<p>Google allows you to log into more than one account at a time. They provide you
with a menu option to switch between the two and you are all set. The problem
is that the constant switching back and forth just isn&rsquo;t worth it.</p>
<h2 id="use-a-desktop-client">Use a desktop client</h2>
<p>If you use a desktop client like Thunderbird or Mail.app, you can have as many
accounts as you want. But you don&rsquo;t get access to your contacts and rarely get
the nice conversation view for your messages. In addition, the applications are
often bloated and use a ton of memory.</p>
<h2 id="use-mutt-or-pino">Use mutt or pino</h2>
<p>These light-weight applications are popular especially among programmers. They
are a pain to setup and lack email address autocompletion.</p>
<h2 id="use-multiple-browsers">Use multiple browsers</h2>
<p>If you have one or two Gmail accounts, you could probably get away with using
two browsers - one for each account. This is silly and you shouldn&rsquo;t do that.</p>
<h2 id="use-chrome-profiles">Use Chrome profiles</h2>
<p>Newer versions of Chome will allow you to be logged into different Gmail
accounts in different windows. This means that each window is logged into a
single Google account and can only access the services associated with that
account. This is fine for two accounts, but if you have 4+ it can get
ridiculous pretty fast.</p>
<p>None of these options give you a good solution for a unified inbox. They all
have their shortcomings.</p>
<p>There is a huge opportunity to disrupt this space as they are a lot of us who
have to use a lot of different Gmail accounts.</p>
<p>I have been using Mozilla Thunderbird with two add-ons: Google contacts and
Google Conversations. They are rather close to doing the right thing but it&rsquo;s
still missing something. I tried to set up mutt but it wasn&rsquo;t working for me
because of the missing autocomplete.</p>
<h2 id="your-say">Your say</h2>
<p>What do you use? How do you deal with this mess?</p>
