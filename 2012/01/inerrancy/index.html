  <p>As evangelical Christians, we believe in what is called the inerrancy of the
Bible. This means that we believe that the Word of God contains no mistakes. I
love the way pastor Mark Driscoll puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we see something in the Bible that we don&rsquo;t agree with, it means we&rsquo;re
wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am continually amazed at how many people will dismiss entire passages in the
Bible as silly or primitive. We are intelligent modern people, we don&rsquo;t believe
in fairy tales. We have democracy now. We believe in equality.</p>
<p>Let me remind you that the Bible is the book that God wrote. Is God different
today and yesterday?</p>
<p>Augustine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you believe what you like in the gospel, and reject what you don&rsquo;t like,
it is not the gospel you believe, but yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>A. Carson:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who don&rsquo;t have a high view of Scripture, do not feel bound to obey
it.</p>
</blockquote>
