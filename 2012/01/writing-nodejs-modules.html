<h1>Writing Node.js&nbsp;modules</h1>
<p>To say that node.js has enjoyed a great deal of positive publicity in the last
few months would most certainly be an understatement. New node.js-related
projects are popping up all over the place, and there seems to be this notion
that if you aren&#8217;t using it you&#8217;re not cool&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>Over the Christmas holidays, I sat down to sort out my photo library and I
wanted to make a web photo gallery to share the images with family and friends.
Being a mainly Python programmer, I wrote a Python script that will go through
all of my photos and create smaller versions and thumbnails of the images that
are suitable for the web. I think I have around 1500 images at the moment and
it took a good 20 minutes to convert everything using Python Imaging&nbsp;Library.</p>
<p>I was rather frustrated with the performance. I think the reason for the
slowness was the fact that the images were processed sequentially, one by one.
What if I could modify my program to process more than one image at a time.
This would certainly speed by the process. Then I thought about using threads
in Python and I think I threw up in my mouth a&nbsp;little.</p>
<p>Then I remembered Node.js. It&#8217;s supposed to be all asynchronous and
non-blocking. Perfect match. So I wrote a thumbnailer in&nbsp;node.</p>
<p>Essentially, it&#8217;s a worker queue that resizes images. You give it a source and
destination directories and a number of workers and run it. The total time went
from 20 minutes to 2 using about 5 workers. Much better,&nbsp;eh?</p>
<p>I decided to open source the project because I couldn&#8217;t find any node.js
projects that do something even remotely similar. It&#8217;s called <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/honza/node-thumbnail">node-thumbnail</a>
and you can find it on both Github and&nbsp;npmjs.</p>
<p>So what does the <span class="caps">API</span> look&nbsp;like?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">thumb</span><span class="p">({</span>
  <span class="nx">source</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;source/path&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">destination</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;dest/path&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="nx">concurrency</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">4</span>

<span class="p">});</span>
