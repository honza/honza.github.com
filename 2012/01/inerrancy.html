<h1>Inerrancy</h1>
<p>As evangelical Christians, we believe in what is called the inerrancy of the
Bible. This means that we believe that the Word of God contains no mistakes. I
love the way pastor Mark Driscoll puts&nbsp;it:</p>
<blockquote>
If we see something in the Bible that we don&#8217;t agree with, it means we&#8217;re
wrong.</blockquote>
<p>I am continually amazed at how many people will dismiss entire passages in the
Bible as silly or primitive. We are intelligent modern people, we don&#8217;t believe
in fairy tales. We have democracy now. We believe in&nbsp;equality.</p>
<p>Let me remind you that the Bible is the book that God wrote. Is God different
today and&nbsp;yesterday?</p>
<p>Augustine:</p>
<blockquote>
If you believe what you like in the gospel, and reject what you don&#8217;t like,
it is not the gospel you believe, but yourself.</blockquote>
<p>D. A.&nbsp;Carson:</p>
<blockquote>
Those who don&#8217;t have a high view of Scripture, do not feel bound to obey
it.</blockquote>
