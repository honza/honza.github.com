<h1>Upgrading your Django media files to use a&nbsp;<span class="caps">CDN</span></h1>
<p>I was using <a class="reference external" href="http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-filebrowser/en/latest/">django-filebrowser</a> on a project and my Rackspace <span class="caps">VM</span> quickly ran
out of disk space. Since the site isn&#8217;t getting much traffic at all, I didn&#8217;t
want to pay extra for a bigger <span class="caps">VM</span>. Instead, I decided to move all of the user
uploaded media to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/files/">Rackspace Cloudfiles</a>. It&#8217;s super cheap and they have a
nice&nbsp;<span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
<p>Now, the challenge was to make the transition from a filebrowser-based system.
First of all, I knew I was going to use <a class="reference external" href="http://django-storages.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html">django-storages</a> as the new storage
class for my class. I played around with it on the side and it worked like a&nbsp;charm.</p>
<p>Next, I wrote a quick little Python script to upload all of the files to
Cloudfiles. Since the filenames didn&#8217;t change at all, I could just write a
South migration that would strip the <tt class="docutils literal">/uploads</tt> part and be done with&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I had a look at the Django documentation to see what exactly a <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/models/fields/#filefield">FileField</a> was.
It turns out it takes a Django <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/ref/files/file/#django.core.files.File">File</a> object which in turn is a thin wrapper
around the Python built-in file object. This didn&#8217;t sound exactly easy to do. I
would have to open a remote file with Python&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">open(&#8216;file.mp3&#8217;)</span></tt> and have
Django inspect it for size and file type. This is clunky at best if you
remember that this will have to live in a South&nbsp;migration.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is the fact that filebrowser&#8217;s model field is a subclass of
<tt class="docutils literal">CharField</tt> and has no special file-related properties or&nbsp;methods.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t use the <tt class="docutils literal">DEFAULT_STORAGE_CLASS</tt> setting because filebrowser will
start yelling at you. Instead, you specify the storage class right in the new
model&nbsp;field.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">storages.backends.mosso</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">cloudfiles_upload_to</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">CloudFilesStorage</span>
<span class="n">cloudfiles_storage</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">CloudFilesStorage</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">Item</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">old_field</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">FileBrowseField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">max_length</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">500</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">blank</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">True</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">new_field</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">models</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FileField</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">upload_to</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">cloudfiles_upload_to</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="n">storage</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">cloudfiles_storage</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">default</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&#39;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Now you can go and write your migration and Django won&#8217;t yell at you. Now we go
back to the problem outlined above. How do you create an instance of <tt class="docutils literal">File</tt>
to pass to <tt class="docutils literal">item.new_field</tt>.</p>
<p>After hours of reading the source and debugging, I realized that you can simply
pass in the filename as a string and the storage class will do the right thing.
It&#8217;s actually really simple and painless. Your data migration might look
something&nbsp;like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">item</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">orm</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">objects</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new_field</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">basename</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">old_field</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">item</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">save</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>So, I was already somewhat overjoyed that this would in fact be easy and then I
discovered that the change from filebrowser to django-storages doesn&#8217;t require
a schema migration. This means that if your file names are the same there is no
database change needed at all. How cool is&nbsp;that?</p>
