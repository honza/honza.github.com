<h1>Disrupt the multiple-gmail&nbsp;space</h1>
<p>We all know that Gmail is the best email provider out there. It&#8217;s in the
browser, it&#8217;s all ajaxy, you never delete anything, your emails are
cleverly organized into conversations, you know the&nbsp;drill&#8230;</p>
<p>But have you ever tried to use more than one account at a time? It&#8217;s horribly
broken. Let&#8217;s have a look at your&nbsp;options&#8230;</p>
<div class="section" id="multiple-sign-in">
<h2>Multiple&nbsp;sign-in</h2>
<p>Google allows you to log into more than one account at a time. They provide you
with a menu option to switch between the two and you are all set. The problem
is that the constant switching back and forth just isn&#8217;t worth&nbsp;it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-a-desktop-client">
<h2>Use a desktop&nbsp;client</h2>
<p>If you use a desktop client like Thunderbird or Mail.app, you can have as many
accounts as you want. But you don&#8217;t get access to your contacts and rarely get
the nice conversation view for your messages. In addition, the applications are
often bloated and use a ton of&nbsp;memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-mutt-or-pino">
<h2>Use mutt or&nbsp;pino</h2>
<p>These light-weight applications are popular especially among programmers. They
are a pain to setup and lack email address&nbsp;autocompletion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-multiple-browsers">
<h2>Use multiple&nbsp;browsers</h2>
<p>If you have one or two Gmail accounts, you could probably get away with using
two browsers - one for each account. This is silly and you shouldn&#8217;t do&nbsp;that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="use-chrome-profiles">
<h2>Use Chrome&nbsp;profiles</h2>
<p>Newer versions of Chome will allow you to be logged into different Gmail
accounts in different windows. This means that each window is logged into a
single Google account and can only access the services associated with that
account. This is fine for two accounts, but if you have 4+ it can get
ridiculous pretty&nbsp;fast.</p>
<p>None of these options give you a good solution for a unified inbox. They all
have their&nbsp;shortcomings.</p>
<p>There is a huge opportunity to disrupt this space as they are a lot of us who
have to use a lot of different Gmail&nbsp;accounts.</p>
<p>I have been using Mozilla Thunderbird with two add-ons: Google contacts and
Google Conversations. They are rather close to doing the right thing but it&#8217;s
still missing something. I tried to set up mutt but it wasn&#8217;t working for me
because of the missing&nbsp;autocomplete.</p>
