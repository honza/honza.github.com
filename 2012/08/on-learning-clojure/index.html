All the parentheses Once you get into learning Clojure and you have written a small application, you don&rsquo;t really see the parens anymore. Sure, sometimes you still get the Unbalanced parens error but those are easy to spot. If you are afraid of learning a LISP because of this, don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll be fine."/>

  <h2 id="prefix-notation">Prefix notation</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of the prefix notation.  It makes everything appear the same
(if-statements, function calls , etc).  I like how it removes the need for
operator precedence rules.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-parentheses">All the parentheses</h2>
<p>Once you get into learning Clojure and you have written a small application,
you don&rsquo;t really see the parens anymore.  Sure, sometimes you still get the
<em>Unbalanced parens</em> error but those are easy to spot.  If you are afraid of
learning a LISP because of this, don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll be fine.</p>
<h2 id="jvm">JVM</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s just say that the start-up time of the JVM isn&rsquo;t the fastest.  This makes
Clojure effectively useless for writing utility scripts.  However, the JVM is a
robust platform that runs your code really fast.  With Clojure, you get all the
benefits of the JVM: garbage collection, JIT, uberjars, etc.  Using Java
libraries in Clojure is usually pretty straightforward if you know the basics
of Java (but the code isn&rsquo;t the prettiest).  This is great because some of the
lower level stuff doesn&rsquo;t have to be reimplemented (think SHA1 digests,
sockets, etc).</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<p>The language itself seems to be documented pretty well.  I haven&rsquo;t had any
issues when trying to find the signature for a built-in function.  However, the
community isn&rsquo;t exactly known for writing documentation.  Most of the time, you
find a library on Github and you are left to read the source.  If you are
lucky, you are told what to import and a few basic examples.  Good
documentation is something I take for granted coming from the Python world.</p>
<h2 id="libraries">Libraries</h2>
<p>While you can certainly find a lot of good libraries for doing common things,
one area is still painful to develop for: the web.  Clojure still needs a
Django-like web framework that has all the batteries included.  Right now, the
only popular web framework is Noir and it&rsquo;s more like Sinatra or Flask.
Without a Django-like platform, you end up reinventing all the common things
for every application: authentication, form validation, ORM, etc.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I really like the language.  I like the functional aspects of it and the
immutability.  I like lazy sequences and refs.  What I don&rsquo;t like is that the
community and the ecosystem is still a bit young and immature.  I find myself
waiting for stuff to happen before I can use this language more.</p>
