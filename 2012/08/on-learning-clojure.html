<h1>On Learning&nbsp;Clojure</h1>
<div class="section" id="prefix-notation">
<h2>Prefix&nbsp;notation</h2>
<p>I&#8217;m a big fan of the prefix notation.  It makes everything appear the same
(if-statements, function calls , etc).  I like how it removes the need for
operator precedence&nbsp;rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="all-the-parentheses">
<h2>All the&nbsp;parentheses</h2>
<p>Once you get into learning Clojure and you have written a small application,
you don&#8217;t really see the parens anymore.  Sure, sometimes you still get the
<em>Unbalanced parens</em> error but those are easy to spot.  If you are afraid of
learning a <span class="caps">LISP</span> because of this, don&#8217;t worry, you&#8217;ll be&nbsp;fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="jvm">
<h2><span class="caps">JVM</span></h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say that the start-up time of the <span class="caps">JVM</span> isn&#8217;t the fastest.  This makes
Clojure effectively useless for writing utility scripts.  However, the <span class="caps">JVM</span> is a
robust platform that runs your code really fast.  With Clojure, you get all the
benefits of the <span class="caps">JVM</span>: garbage collection, <span class="caps">JIT</span>, uberjars, etc.  Using Java
libraries in Clojure is usually pretty straightforward if you know the basics
of Java (but the code isn&#8217;t the prettiest).  This is great because some of the
lower level stuff doesn&#8217;t have to be reimplemented (think <span class="caps">SHA1</span> digests,
sockets,&nbsp;etc).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The language itself seems to be documented pretty well.  I haven&#8217;t had any
issues when trying to find the signature for a built-in function.  However, the
community isn&#8217;t exactly known for writing documentation.  Most of the time, you
find a library on Github and you are left to read the source.  If you are
lucky, you are told what to import and a few basic examples.  Good
documentation is something I take for granted coming from the Python&nbsp;world.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="libraries">
<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>While you can certainly find a lot of good libraries for doing common things,
one area is still painful to develop for: the web.  Clojure still needs a
Django-like web framework that has all the batteries included.  Right now, the
only popular web framework is Noir and it&#8217;s more like Sinatra or Flask.
Without a Django-like platform, you end up reinventing all the common things
for every application: authentication, form validation, <span class="caps">ORM</span>,&nbsp;etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I really like the language.  I like the functional aspects of it and the
immutability.  I like lazy sequences and refs.  What I don&#8217;t like is that the
community and the ecosystem is still a bit young and immature.  I find myself
waiting for stuff to happen before I can use this language&nbsp;more.</p>
