<h1>Gender inclusive&nbsp;language</h1>
<p>In a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.bedfordbaptist.ca/services/156">recent sermon</a> at our church, a pastor student said to us that we are no
longer able to say that Jesus will make his disciples <em>fishers of men</em>. Rather,
she suggested, we should use the politically correct phrase <em>fishers of
people</em>.</p>
<p>There is always talk of gender-inclusive language when it comes to Bible
translation.  But this one seems a little too far.  Or it doesn&#8217;t feel&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>As I have been thinking about this, I came across other things we say that that
are sexist in this way that don&#8217;t seem to bother&nbsp;anyone.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Watch any detective show and without fail, the perpetrator or killer will
be called <em>he</em> and <em>him</em>.  Women never&nbsp;kill.</li>
<li>Within the committees of our church, we longer say <em>chairman</em> but
<em>chairperson</em>.  If we were to follow that same logic, we should refer to
<em>snowmen</em> as <em>snowpeople</em>.</li>
<li>The other day, my family visited my mother-in-law while she was selling her
home <span class="amp">&amp;</span> gift products at an event.  At one point, she said &#8220;&#8230; I can&#8217;t I&#8217;m
manning my table.&#8221;  Was she really?  Shouldn&#8217;t she have said <em>womanning</em>?</li>
</ol>
<p>A little&nbsp;absurd.</p>
