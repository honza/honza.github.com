<h1>Standing desk - first&nbsp;impressions</h1>
<p>I have recently switched jobs and had to set up a home office.  I have heard a
lot of good things about standing desks and thought this was the perfect
opportunity to try one.  I had looked for one online but those things aren&#8217;t
cheap (~&nbsp;$800).</p>
<p>Instead of dropping some serious cash, I stacked up some bins and made a
poorman&#8217;s standing desk.  I have a laptop stand and a second monitor.  Nothing
special,&nbsp;really.</p>
<p>I have been standing while programming for over a week now and I wanted to
share a few thoughts.  If you&#8217;re wondering if you should get a standing desk,
I&#8217;d definitely recommend&nbsp;it.</p>
<div class="section" id="incentives">
<h2>Incentives</h2>
<p>I have set up my desk in such a way that if I want to sit down to do some work
I have to give up the second monitor and my Das keyboard.  I use a 13&#8221; Macbook
Pro so the number of pixels is rather limited.  I <em>love</em> my loud Das keyboard
and want to use it as much as possible.  This works extremely&nbsp;well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="breaks">
<h2>Breaks</h2>
<p>When I take a break to have lunch with my family (or something like that), I
make it a point to sit down and rest my feet.  When I get back in the office, I
don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m gonna&nbsp;die.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="distractions">
<h2>Distractions</h2>
<p>I have found that when I&#8217;m standing I rarely check Hacker News or read
articles.  I think it&#8217;s because reading an article or two isn&#8217;t complex enough
for my brain and it can do other things at the same time&#8212;like think about how
much my feet hurt.  I find that when I&#8217;m standing I get a lot more done because
I can focus a lot more.  Near the end of the day when I&#8217;m tired and actually do
sit down to work, I feel like I&#8217;m walking under water.  Since I&#8217;m just getting
started I have allowed myself some slack here and there.  I don&#8217;t want to go
too fast and <em>burn out</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dancing">
<h2>Dancing</h2>
<p>I have heard that people like to dance when they&#8217;re standing at their desk.  I
always thought this was pretty silly until I caught myself doing it.  I listen
to a lot of rock n roll so it&#8217;s not exactly&nbsp;surprising.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pain">
<h2>Pain</h2>
<p>Obviously, your feet will hurt.  However, it&#8217;s not nearly as bad as I thought.
I&#8217;m 23 and fairly fit so maybe that&#8217;s a factor.  I have had some minor lower
back pain which I think is caused by the fact that I now have good posture and
the body isn&#8217;t used to&nbsp;it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Do you stand while working?  Ever thought about getting a standing&nbsp;desk?</p>
