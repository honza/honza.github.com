<article>
  

<p>I have recently switched jobs and had to set up a home office.  I have heard a
lot of good things about standing desks and thought this was the perfect
opportunity to try one.  I had looked for one online but those things aren&rsquo;t
cheap (~ $800).</p>

<p>Instead of dropping some serious cash, I stacked up some bins and made a
poorman&rsquo;s standing desk.  I have a laptop stand and a second monitor.  Nothing
special, really.</p>

<p>I have been standing while programming for over a week now and I wanted to
share a few thoughts.  If you&rsquo;re wondering if you should get a standing desk,
I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it.</p>

<h2 id="incentives">Incentives</h2>

<p>I have set up my desk in such a way that if I want to sit down to do some work
I have to give up the second monitor and my Das keyboard.  I use a 13&rdquo; Macbook
Pro so the number of pixels is rather limited.  I <em>love</em> my loud Das keyboard
and want to use it as much as possible.  This works extremely well.</p>

<h2 id="breaks">Breaks</h2>

<p>When I take a break to have lunch with my family (or something like that), I
make it a point to sit down and rest my feet.  When I get back in the office, I
don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m gonna die.</p>

<h2 id="distractions">Distractions</h2>

<p>I have found that when I&rsquo;m standing I rarely check Hacker News or read
articles.  I think it&rsquo;s because reading an article or two isn&rsquo;t complex enough
for my brain and it can do other things at the same time&mdash;like think about how
much my feet hurt.  I find that when I&rsquo;m standing I get a lot more done because
I can focus a lot more.  Near the end of the day when I&rsquo;m tired and actually do
sit down to work, I feel like I&rsquo;m walking under water.  Since I&rsquo;m just getting
started I have allowed myself some slack here and there.  I don&rsquo;t want to go
too fast and <em>burn out</em>.</p>

<h2 id="dancing">Dancing</h2>

<p>I have heard that people like to dance when they&rsquo;re standing at their desk.  I
always thought this was pretty silly until I caught myself doing it.  I listen
to a lot of rock n roll so it&rsquo;s not exactly surprising.</p>

<h2 id="pain">Pain</h2>

<p>Obviously, your feet will hurt.  However, it&rsquo;s not nearly as bad as I thought.
I&rsquo;m 23 and fairly fit so maybe that&rsquo;s a factor.  I have had some minor lower
back pain which I think is caused by the fact that I now have good posture and
the body isn&rsquo;t used to it.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Do you stand while working?  Ever thought about getting a standing desk?</p>
