  <p>The sidebar in Mutt is useful if you have multiple email accounts and want to
switch between them quickly.  It shows you each inbox with a number of unread
emails.  I have 6 Gmail accounts plugged into my Mutt and here is what I used
to see.</p>
<pre><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">INBOX (1)
INBOX
INBOX (2)
INBOX (1)
INBOX (7)
INBOX
</code></pre><p>And I had to remember which one was which.  Let&rsquo;s say you have your mailboxes
in <code>~/.mail</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">$ ls ~/.mail
work home
</code></pre><p>Create a directory called <code>aliases</code> and symlink the inboxes to that
directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">$ ln -s ~/.mail/work/INBOX ~/.mail/alias/work
$ ln -s ~/.mail/home/INBOX ~/.mail/alias/home
</code></pre><p>Then, point your Mutt sidebar config at those.  When you open Mutt the next
time, it should look like this</p>
<pre><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">work (1)
home (8)
</code></pre><p>That&rsquo;s much more useful than just a list of <code>INBOX</code> things.</p>
