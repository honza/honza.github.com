<article>
  <p>In the last year or so, there seems to have been an explosion of markdown
editors and markdown previewers. A quick Google search reveals <a href="http://dillinger.io/">so</a>, <a href="https://stackedit.io/">many</a>
of <a href="http://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/">them</a>.</p>
<p>The App Store is also full of these kinds of apps, promising you unrivaled
productivity and writing bliss.</p>
<p><img src="/images/app-store-markdown.png" alt="">But, I would submit to you that all of these apps miss the point of markdown.
From the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown project page</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The overriding design goal for Markdown&rsquo;s formatting syntax is to make it
as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document
should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it&rsquo;s been
marked up with tags or formatting instructions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The syntax (or lack thereof) of the markdown format is so simple that there is
no need to &ldquo;preview&rdquo; the result. A heading looks like a heading. A list looks
like a list.</p>
<p>This is a prime example of creating a solution to a problem that doesn&rsquo;t exist.
The reason why these apps are popular and people buy them has less to do with
the need to preview markdown and more with the hisperized culture of writing
for the web.</p>
