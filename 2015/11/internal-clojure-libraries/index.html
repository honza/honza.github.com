  <h1>Internal Clojure libraries</h1>

<article>
  <p>At work, we have a few Clojure services in production.  Each service is its own
leiningen project with its own dependencies.  And because setting up a local
maven repository is hard, each project reimplements quite a bit of logic.  This
duplicate code usually relates to the non-essential but still important parts
of a service: logging, metrics, sentry integration, etc.</p>

<p>Just the other day, I was getting really annoyed with this situation, and was
about ready to go learn about the wonderful intricacies of Maven, when I
discovered leiningen&rsquo;s <code>install</code> command.</p>

<p>With <code>lein install</code>, you can install your library as a jar and a pom to the
local repository.  Here, local repository means a local repository, typically
in <code>~/.m2</code>.  Your apps can then depend on this library via the normal
<code>:dependencies</code> list in the project file.  This is all completely seamless
and works well.</p>

<p>Apparently, this command has been around for a long time.</p>

<p>Armed with this new information, I was able to create an internal project
called <em>metrics</em> and remove a ton of duplication.  <code>lein install</code> also allows
multiple versions of the same library to be installed at once.  Simply require
whatever version you need in your apps&rsquo; <code>project.clj</code> file.</p>

<p>This makes developing Clojure projects without having to publish your libraries
to Clojars a lot easier.</p>
