<h1>Internal Clojure&nbsp;libraries</h1>
<p>At work, we have a few Clojure services in production.  Each service is its own
leiningen project with its own dependencies.  And because setting up a local
maven repository is hard, each project reimplements quite a bit of logic.  This
duplicate code usually relates to the non-essential but still important parts
of a service: logging, metrics, sentry integration,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>Just the other day, I was getting really annoyed with this situation, and was
about ready to go learn about the wonderful intricacies of Maven, when I
discovered leiningen&#8217;s <tt class="docutils literal">install</tt> command.</p>
<p>With <tt class="docutils literal">lein install</tt>, you can install your library as a jar and a pom to the
local repository.  Here, local repository means a local repository, typically
in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.m2</span></tt>.  Your apps can then depend on this library via the normal
<tt class="docutils literal">:dependencies</tt> list in the project file.  This is all completely seamless
and works&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>Apparently, this command has been around for a long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Armed with this new information, I was able to create an internal project
called <em>metrics</em> and remove a ton of duplication.  <tt class="docutils literal">lein install</tt> also allows
multiple versions of the same library to be installed at once.  Simply require
whatever version you need in your apps&#8217; <tt class="docutils literal">project.clj</tt> file.</p>
<p>This makes developing Clojure projects without having to publish your libraries
to Clojars a lot&nbsp;easier.</p>
