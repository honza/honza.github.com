<h1>Calvin on&nbsp;predestination</h1>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/institutes.v.xxiii.html">Book 3, chapter&nbsp;23</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When Paul declares that we were chosen in Christ before the foundation of
the world (Eph. 1:4), he certainly shows that no regard is had to our own
worth; for it is just as if he had said, Since in the whole seed of Adam
our heavenly Father found nothing worthy of his election, he turned his eye
upon his own Anointed, that he might select as members of his body those
whom he was to assume into the fellowship of&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>By saying they were elected before the foundation of the world, he takes
away all reference to&nbsp;worth.</p>
<p>In the additional statement that they were elected that they might be holy,
the apostle openly refutes the error of those who deduce election from
prescience, since he declares that whatever virtue appears in men is the
result of&nbsp;election.</p>
<p>Then, if a higher cause is asked, Paul answers that God so predestined, and
predestined according to the good pleasure of his&nbsp;will.</p>
<p>If you say that he foresaw they would be holy, and therefore elected them,
you invert the order of Paul.  You may, therefore, safely infer, If he
elected us that we might be holy, he did not elect us because he foresaw
that we would be&nbsp;holy.</p>
<p>Hence, what Christ said to his disciples is found to be universally
applicable to all believers, &#8220;Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen
you,&#8221; (John&nbsp;15:16)</p>
<p>In another passage, to suppress the vain boasting of those who, while only
covered with a mask, claim for themselves in the view of the world a first
place among the godly, Paul says, &#8220;The Lord knoweth them that are his,&#8221; (2
Tim. 2:19). In short, by that term he designates two classes of people, the
one consisting of the whole race of Abraham, the other a people separated
from that race, and though hidden from human view, yet open to the eye of
God. And there is no doubt that he took the passage from Moses, who
declares that God would be merciful to whomsoever he&nbsp;pleased</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>All that the Father giveth me shall come to me.&#8221; &#8220;And this is the Father&#8217;s
will which has sent me, that of all which he has given me I should lose
nothing,&#8221; (John 6:37, 39). Observe that the donation of the Father is the
first step in our delivery into the charge and protection of Christ. Some
one, perhaps, will here turn round and object, that those only peculiarly
belong to the Father who make a voluntary surrender by faith. But the only
thing which Christ maintains is that though the defections of vast
multitudes should shake the world, yet the counsel of God would stand firm,
more stable than heaven itself, that his election would never fail. The
elect are said to have belonged to the Father before he bestowed them on
his only begotten&nbsp;Son.</p>
<p>We must, indeed hold, when he affirms that he knows whom he has chosen,
first, that some individuals of the human race are denoted; and, secondly,
that they are not distinguished by the quality of their virtues, but by a
heavenly decree. Hence it follows, that since Christ makes himself the
author of election, none excel by their own strength or&nbsp;industry.</p>
<p>For when he says, &#8220;Those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them
is lost but the son of perdition,&#8221; (John 17:12), the expression, though
there is a catachresis in it, is not at all ambiguous. The sum is, that God
by gratuitous adoption forms those whom he wishes to have for sons; but
that the intrinsic cause is in himself, because he is contented with his
secret&nbsp;pleasure.</p>
<p>Some object that God would be inconsistent with himself, in inviting all
without distinction while he elects only a few. Thus, according to them,
the universality of the promise destroys the distinction of special grace.
[&#8230;] by external preaching all are called to faith and repentance, and
that yet the Spirit of faith and repentance is not given to all [&#8230;] But
it is by Isaiah he more clearly demonstrates how he destines the promises
of salvation specially to the elect (Isa. 8:16); for he declares that his
disciples would consist of them only, and not indiscriminately of the whole
human race. Whence it is evident that the doctrine of salvation, which is
said to be set apart for the sons of the Church only, is abused when it is
represented as effectually available to all. [&#8230;] Isaiah assigns the cause
when he says that the arm of the Lord is not revealed to all (Isa.&nbsp;53:1).</p>
<p>How, then, can it consistently be said, that God calls while he knows that
the called will not come? [&#8230;] Moreover, if election is, as Paul declares,
the parent of faith, I retort the argument, and maintain that faith is not
general, since election is special. For it is easily inferred from the
series of causes and effects, when Paul says, that the Father &#8220;has blessed
us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ, according as
he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world,&#8221; (Eph. 1:3, 4),
that these riches are not common to all, because God has chosen only whom
he&nbsp;would.</p>
<p>We come now to the reprobate, to whom the Apostle at the same time refers
(Rom. 9:13). For as Jacob, who as yet had merited nothing by good works, is
assumed into favor; so Esau, while as yet unpolluted by any crime, is
hated. If we turn our view to works, we do injustice to the Apostle, as if
he had failed to see the very thing which is clear to us. Moreover, there
is complete proof of his not having seen it, since he expressly insists
that when as yet they had done neither good nor evil, the one was elected,
the other rejected, in order to prove that the foundation of divine
predestination is not in works. Then after starting the objection, Is God
unjust? instead of employing what would have been the surest and plainest
defense of his justice-viz. that God had recompensed Esau according to his
wickedness, he is contented with a different solution-viz. that the
reprobate are expressly raised up, in order that the glory of God may
thereby be displayed. At last, he concludes that God has mercy on whom he
will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth (Rom. 9:18). You see how he
refers both to the mere pleasure of God. Therefore, if we cannot assign any
reason for his bestowing mercy on his people, but just that it so pleases
him, neither can we have any reason for his reprobating others but his
will. When God is said to visit in mercy or harden whom he will, men are
reminded that they are not to seek for any cause beyond his&nbsp;will.</p>
