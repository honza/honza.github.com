  <p>Reading stuff online can become addictive.  So addictive, in fact, that it can
negatively affect your productivity as a programmer.  Most of us go to Hacker
News or Reddit to get our dose of news.  We justify it by saying that it&rsquo;s
<em>research</em> or that we are <em>trying to stay current in the community</em>.  Whatever
your excuse, you know you have a problem when you check Hacker News every ten
minutes just to see if anything new and awesome has been added.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Close Hacker News and open a f***ing book.&rdquo;

<p>Maybe you have already gotten over the initial self-denial and you have added
some entries to your <code>/etc/hosts</code> file to keep yourself from constantly going
to those sites.  That&rsquo;s all well and good but I think we can do better.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already opened the tab and you are now staring at a blank error page.
Why not put something more useful there?</p>
<p>Me, I like to learn new things.  There are way too many things I&rsquo;d like to
learn.  Why not show a list of things I&rsquo;d like to learn and allow me to click
through to the website?</p>
<p>I have installed nginx on my machine and set up a simple static page with a few
links things like <em>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</em> or Steve Losh&rsquo;s <em>Learn
Vimscript the Hardway</em>.  Now every time I go to HN, I see those links and am
reminded that I wanted to spend some time learning those things&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>
<p>Install nginx.  <code>brew install nginx</code> or <code>sudo apt-get install nginx</code> or
whatever might apply to you.</p>
<p>Stick this in your <code>nginx.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">worker_processes  1;

http {
    include       mime.types;
    default_type  application/octet-stream;

    keepalive_timeout  65;

    server {
        listen       443;
        server_name  news.ycombinator.com;

        ssl                  on;
        ssl_certificate      /usr/local/etc/nginx/server.crt;
        ssl_certificate_key  /usr/local/etc/nginx/server.key;

        location / {
            root   html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }
    }

    server {
        listen       80;
        server_name  reddit.com;

        location / {
            root   html;
            index  index.html index.htm;
        }
    }

}
</code></pre><p>If any of the sites you are blocking are served over SSL, you will need to get
a self-signed certificate.  This is a one time setup and doesn&rsquo;t really take
that long to do.</p>
<pre><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">$ openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out server.crt -keyout server.key
$ chmod 600 server.key
</code></pre><p>Now you just place those two files to the locations referenced in the above
<code>nginx.conf</code> file and restart nginx.</p>
<p>And here is how you can make Chrome stop complaining about your self-signed
certificate (<a href="http://www.robpeck.com/2010/10/google-chrome-mac-os-x-and-self-signed-ssl-certificates/">source</a>).</p>
<h3 id="in-the-address-bar-click-the-little-lock-with-the-x-dot-this-will-bring-up-a">In the address bar, click the little lock with the X. This will bring up a</h3>
<p>small information screen. Click the button that says &ldquo;Certificate
Information.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="click-and-drag-the-image-to-your-desktop-dot-it-looks-like-a-little">Click and drag the image to your desktop. It looks like a little</h3>
<p>certificate.</p>
<h3 id="double-click-it-dot-this-will-bring-up-the-keychain-access-utility-dot-enter-your">Double-click it. This will bring up the Keychain Access utility. Enter your</h3>
<p>password to unlock it.</p>
<h3 id="be-sure-you-add-the-certificate-to-the-system-keychain-not-the-login">Be sure you add the certificate to the System keychain, not the login</h3>
<p>keychain. Click &ldquo;Always Trust,&rdquo; even though this doesn&rsquo;t seem to do
anything.</p>
<h3 id="after-it-has-been-added-double-click-it-dot-you-may-have-to-authenticate">After it has been added, double-click it. You may have to authenticate</h3>
<p>again. Expand the &ldquo;Trust&rdquo; section.</p>
<h3 id="when-using-this-certificate-set-to-always-trust">&ldquo;When using this certificate,&rdquo; set to &ldquo;Always Trust&rdquo;</h3>
<h3 id="that-s-it-close-keychain-access-and-restart-chrome-and-your-self-signed">That&rsquo;s it! Close Keychain Access and restart Chrome, and your self-signed</h3>
<p>certificate should be recognized now by the browser.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully, this will be helpful to you and nudge you every now and then to
learn something you&rsquo;ve been putting off.</p>
