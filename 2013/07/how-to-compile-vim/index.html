  <p>&hellip; from source when you&rsquo;re using the homebrew-provided Python.</p>
<p>If you have installed Python via homebrew, your vim will compile fine but when
a plugin tries to use Python to do some its work, vim will crash like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/vim-crash.png" alt="">Not pretty.</p>
<p>Apparently, this is because vim will use the first Python it can find which in
our case the homebrew-provided one. You can of course get a pre-compiled
version and ignore this. But I like to use the latest version of vim and with
the 7.4 beta, I have been doing that a lot lately&hellip;</p>
<p>So, what is one to do? We have to fix the <code>PATH</code>. Here is the script that I
use to recompile vim. This goes in the root of the vim project.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">export PATH<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/bin

./configure <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>        --enable-perlinterp <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>        --enable-pythoninterp <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>        --enable-rubyinterp <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>        --enable-cscope <span style="color:#ae81ff">\
</span><span style="color:#ae81ff"></span>        --with-features<span style="color:#f92672">=</span>huge

make
</code></pre></div><p>There and vim is now compiled properly with Python support that won&rsquo;t make you
cry.</p>
<p>Thanks to Steve Losh for pointing me in the right direction on this.</p>
