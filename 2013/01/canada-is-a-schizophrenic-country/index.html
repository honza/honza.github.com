  <p>I have now lived in Canada for over two years and there are some things that
Canadians can&rsquo;t seem to make up their mind on.</p>
<h2 id="spelling">Spelling</h2>
<p>Canadian spelling is stuck half way between British spelling and American
spelling.  Canadians will say:</p>
<h3 id="colour-favourite-honour--which-are-all-british">colour, favourite, honour (which are all British)</h3>
<h3 id="program-realize--which-are-all-american">program, realize (which are all American)</h3>
<h2 id="measuring-units">Measuring units</h2>
<p>When you&rsquo;re driving in Canada, everything is in kilometers.  Snow fall is
measured in centimeters.  And yet, people insist on weighing and measuring
themselves in pounds.  We just had a baby girl here in Canada and they kept
saying, <em>Look she is so big, she is probably over eight.</em>.  Sure, she was nice
and big but she certainly didn&rsquo;t weight 8kg!  People ask me, <em>How tall are
you?</em>, and I respond with 178 and receive blank stares.</p>
