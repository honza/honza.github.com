<h1>Canada is a schizophrenic&nbsp;country</h1>
<p>I have now lived in Canada for over two years and there are some things that
Canadians can&#8217;t seem to make up their mind&nbsp;on.</p>
<div class="section" id="spelling">
<h2>Spelling</h2>
<p>Canadian spelling is stuck half way between British spelling and American
spelling.  Canadians will&nbsp;say:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>colour, favourite, honour (which are all&nbsp;British)</li>
<li>program, realize (which are all&nbsp;American)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="measuring-units">
<h2>Measuring&nbsp;units</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re driving in Canada, everything is in kilometers.  Snow fall is
measured in centimeters.  And yet, people insist on weighing and measuring
themselves in pounds.  We just had a baby girl here in Canada and they kept
saying, <em>Look she is so big, she is probably over eight.</em>.  Sure, she was nice
and big but she certainly didn&#8217;t weight 8kg!  People ask me, <em>How tall are
you?</em>, and I respond with 178 and receive blank&nbsp;stares.</p>
