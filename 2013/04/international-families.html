<h1>International&nbsp;families</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m from the Czech republic.  My wife is from Canada.  We got married in
Canada.  Our son was born in the United Kingdom.  Our daughter was born in
Canada.  Both of our children are by birth Czech and Canadian at the same&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>We want our children to be able to prove both of those citizenships and the
following is the&nbsp;process.</p>
<div class="section" id="our-son">
<h2>Our&nbsp;son</h2>
<p>Our son Wyatt was born in the <span class="caps">UK</span>.  He has a British birth certificate but is
not a British citizen.  In order to travel out of the <span class="caps">UK</span>, he had to get a
passport.  Because we now live in Canada, we decided it would make more sense
to get the Canadian one done&nbsp;first.</p>
<p>In order for someone without a Canadian birth certificate to get a Canadian
passport, you need to get a proof of citizenship.  This is a piece of paper
that Wyatt will have to use for the rest of his life to prove his Canadian
citizenship instead of a birth certificate like all normal&nbsp;Canadians.</p>
<p>So, to get a passport, you first need a proof of citizenship.  Wyatt is a
Canadian citizen because his mother is Canadian.  In order to get the proof of
citizenship, you need to send a superlegalized British birth certificate to the
Canadian government and include the mother&#8217;s birth certificate to prove the she
is Canadian.  Super what?  Superlegalization is a process whereby Canada and
the <span class="caps">UK</span> agree to authorize the use of each other&#8217;s legal documents.  Wyatt&#8217;s
British birth certificate must be stamped by a Canadian embassy in the <span class="caps">UK</span> to
say that this is in fact a legal document issued by the United Kingdom.  Also,
along with his application we had to send in our marriage&nbsp;certificate.</p>
<p>Once he&#8217;s obtained the proof of citizenship, we can apply for a passport.
Fortunately, the Canadian government is nice enough to allow you to apply for
the proof of citizenship and the passport on one application.  We had his
passport in a few&nbsp;weeks.</p>
<p>Now we are living in Canada and want to get him all the papers he needs to be a
true Czech citizen.  This means that we need to have his British birth
certificate legalized by the <span class="caps">UK</span>, then translated into Czech by a
government-approved translator, then approved by the Ministry of Interior of
the Czech republic and then we can apply for a Czech birth certificate.  Of
course, the application requires us to send in our marriage certificate.  Since
we got married in Canada, we have a Canadian marriage certificate.  This means
that we need to have to superlegalized, translated into Czech and approved by
the Ministry.  More fees and translators aren&#8217;t&nbsp;cheap.</p>
<p>Once he has a Czech birth certificate, he needs to apply for a birth number
which isn&#8217;t unlike a social security number except it&#8217;s derived from your date
of&nbsp;birth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="our-daughter">
<h2>Our&nbsp;daughter</h2>
<p>Our daughter Eli≈°ka was born in Canada.  This means she can fortunately get a
Canadian passport without any issues.  She is a real Canadian like most people
and doesn&#8217;t need to have any special paperwork to prove that she is.  Piece of&nbsp;cake.</p>
<p>When it comes to the Czech side of things, it&#8217;s seems it&#8217;s much more
complicated than with our&nbsp;son.</p>
<p>First, she needs to apply for a proof of Czech citizenship.  Her Canadian birth
certificate needs to be superlegalized, translated and approved.  This is
fortunately done at the Czech embassy in Ottawa and you are allowed to
translate the document yourself and they will verify it for you.  One of the
forms that you need to send in with the application requires you to have your
signature verified by a notary.  No big deal, right?  Well, good luck finding a
notary in Canada who speaks Czech and is willing to notarize your signature.  I
was emailing back and forth with the embassy that they allowed me to photocopy
my <span class="caps">ID</span> and take that to the notary instead.  I&#8217;ll sign it in front of him and he
can verify my identity and signature.  I&#8217;ll send this in along with the
application.  The application process takes about 4-6 months according to their&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>I have yet to apply for this.  But when it comes back, we will have to apply
for a Czech birth certificate and a birth number.  More forms, more fees, more
superlegalization,&nbsp;etc.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>No matter what you do, do not romanticize international families.  It&#8217;s not all
that fun all the&nbsp;time&#8230;</p>
