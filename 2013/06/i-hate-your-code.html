<h1>I hate your&nbsp;code</h1>
<p>When starting to work on an existing codebase, I often find myself in a state
of despair.  The code doesn&#8217;t make any sense, the programmers must have all
been idiots, why <em>on earth</em> would they do it like this, &#8230;  I hate everything
about the&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>I spend hours going through it, thinking to myself, <em>I would have done a much
better job writing this</em> and making a list of changes that <em>must</em> be done in
order for the project to conform to my&nbsp;standards.</p>
<p>But then, when I have spent enough time reading everything, something clicks in
my mind.  I see what the authors were trying to do and everything makes sense.
It&#8217;s actually kind of&nbsp;clever.</p>
<p>And I feel dumb.  Every&nbsp;time.</p>
