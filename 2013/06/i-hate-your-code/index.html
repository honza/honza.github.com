  <p>When starting to work on an existing codebase, I often find myself in a state
of despair. The code doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, the programmers must have all
been idiots, why <em>on earth</em> would they do it like this, &hellip; I hate everything
about the code.</p>
<p>I spend hours going through it, thinking to myself, <em>I would have done a much
better job writing this</em> and making a list of changes that <em>must</em> be done in
order for the project to conform to my standards.</p>
<p>But then, when I have spent enough time reading everything, something clicks in
my mind. I see what the authors were trying to do and everything makes sense.
It&rsquo;s actually kind of clever.</p>
<p>And I feel dumb. Every time.</p>
