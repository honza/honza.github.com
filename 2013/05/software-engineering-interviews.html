<h1>Software Engineering&nbsp;Interviews</h1>
<p>If you find yourself interviewing for a software engineering position today,
you can be 90 percent sure that you will be asked to solve some programming&nbsp;puzzles.</p>
<p>We’ve all been there.  You come to the office for an interview, spend a few
minutes talking about the job and you, and then the inevitable hits:
programming puzzles and quizzes.  You are asked to solve nonsensical,
irrelevant, theoretical problems on the spot while the interviewer waits.
These problems in no way represent the actual work for which you’re&nbsp;interviewing.</p>
<p>How do you detect a palindrome?  What is the worst-case performance of the
quicksort algorithm?  How do you find depth of a binary tree?  These are all
utter nonsense.  If your cutting-edge application needs to detect palindromes,
I’m pretty sure you have bigger problems than you think.  All of these can be
easily solved after a few minutes of research on the&nbsp;Internet.</p>
<p>I get especially annoyed at these things because my mind doesn’t work well in
this area.  I don’t like to solve unrealistic problems.  My nonsense detector
kicks in and I can’t concentrate.  Instead, ask me if I know how to debug
messaging queue issues, how I like to set up a new server, how I like to run my
Django apps, how I’d solve a specific problem you’re having, etc.  Have me work
on your product alongside someone in your company.  Get to know me.  I can
program.  I’m good at what I do.  I’m just not good at those stupid&nbsp;puzzles.</p>
<p>It’s not that I don&#8217;t like to think.  I’m learning Haskell and I think I have
understood monads (don’t ask me to explain them to you though).  I like parsers
and parser combinators.  That stuff is hard to understand and takes some serious
alone time to&nbsp;grok.</p>
<p>I’m sure you can find a person out there who is the inverse of me.  They love
puzzles and excel at them.  They get to the final round of Google Jam.  I
don’t. Not even close.  But they are terrible programmers.  Who would you
rather hire?  Every now and then I get this idea that I’ll go and learn a whole
bunch of puzzles and quizzes so I can wow the next interviewer.  But then I
inevitably start to feel dishonest and drop the whole&nbsp;thing.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-to-interview-someone">
<h2>How to interview&nbsp;someone</h2>
<p>Find a small problem in your code base.  Give them access to your Git
repository.  Assign the ticket to them.  Explain why it’s a problem and suggest
a few possible solutions.  Have them work on it either alone or alongside one
of your developers.  This gives your team the chance to get to know this
potential hire and see if they would be a good fit.  This is how I interviewed
at Amara and it was&nbsp;great.</p>
<p>I’d like to end with a brilliant <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/holman/status/154986236640112641">Zach Holman</a> quote on&nbsp;interview:</p>
<blockquote>
I think programming riddles, games, and brain teasers are a great way to
hire. First one to say &#8220;fuck this&#8221; and walk out gets the job.</blockquote>
