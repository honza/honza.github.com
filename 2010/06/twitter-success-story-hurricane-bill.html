<h1>Twitter Success Story - Hurricane&nbsp;Bill</h1>
<p>Beginners often find Twitter very confusing and useless. I think it&#8217;s because
they come to it with some preconceived ideas, and when Twitter doesn&#8217;t fit
their model they get frustrated. This series is meant to show why Twitter is so
useful and how it&#8217;s different from other social&nbsp;networks.</p>
<p>My family and I live in the city of Aberdeen in Scotland. My wife is originally
from Halifax, Canada where her parents still live. In August of last year,
there was a hurricane threat to the Halifax area. The hurricane was slowly
making its way up the coast towards Halifax, and was to strike the city around
8:<span class="caps">00AM</span> on a Sunday morning. Naturally, we were in touch with my in-laws and
kept checking news sites for&nbsp;updates.</p>
<p>However, as you might expect the news companies were closed (or at least on
limited staff) on that Sunday morning. We googled and googled and couldn&#8217;t find
any updates on the hurricane. Did it hit the city? Is it serious? Has
electricity been cut&nbsp;off?</p>
<p>Twitter is a source of real-time information. With the right query, you can get
updates and news just about anything. So, I searched for &#8220;hurricane bill
halifax&#8221; and just watched the tweets come in. At first, there wasn&#8217;t much. But
as time went by, people started talking about the hurricane. Some were saying
that the sky is a bit darker, some were seeing a little rain, etc. I even found
one user who actually went to the Halifax harbour to watch the hurricane come
in. He was posting images from his cell phone to show us what the weather was&nbsp;like.</p>
<p>Thanks to Twitter we were able to follow the development of the hurricane
almost minute by minute. In the end, there wasn&#8217;t much of hurricane after all.
By the time it got to Halifax, it had reduced to a mere&nbsp;storm.</p>
