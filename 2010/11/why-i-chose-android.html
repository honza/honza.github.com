<h1>Why I Chose&nbsp;Android</h1>
<p>Recently, we have heard that the Android operating system has the largest
market share in the <span class="caps">US</span>, and is set to take over the whole world. Personally, I
chose Android long before it was this popular.&nbsp;Why?</p>
<div class="section" id="background">
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I won&#8217;t bore you with my personal history, but I&#8217;d like to say a few things.
I&#8217;m a programmer and like to tweet things. If there isn&#8217;t an application that
does the job, I write it myself. Couple years ago, I was given the then amazing
iPhone 3G. I was thrilled. Everyone wanted one, and I had&nbsp;it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="motorola-droid">
<h2>Motorola&nbsp;Droid</h2>
<p>I sold the iPhone, and bought a Motorola Droid. Why? It&#8217;s actually pretty
simple. I don&#8217;t like closed systems. If you want to develop an application for
the iPhone, you have to buy an Apple computer. You have to use XCode, the
objective-C <span class="caps">IDE</span>. And only after your application gets approved, you can use it
on your phone. I don&#8217;t like the idea of spending an upwards of $1,000 to get an
underpowered machine just to be able to write an&nbsp;app.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="blackberry">
<h2>Blackberry</h2>
<p>After deciding, I wanted to get off the iPhone train, I started looking around
for a new smartphone. The first choice was Blackberry. A serious Canadian
company, business-class smartphones, good prices, &#8230; What&#8217;s not to like? Well,
it turns out that you need Microsoft Windows in order to properly develop and
test your Blackberry application. Being an avid Linux user, I very much
disliked the idea of going back to Windows just because of&nbsp;Blackberry.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="enter-android">
<h2>Enter&nbsp;Android</h2>
<p>Android was my next choice. I browsed over to the developers&#8217; website to see if
I can make apps for this platform. When I saw that Windows, Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> and Linux
were supported, I almost cried for joy! I learned that Android runs on the
Linux kernel, apps are written in Java using the open source&nbsp;<span class="caps">SDK</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="google">
<h2>Google</h2>
<p>Yes, Google is behind this whole thing. You may not exactly care unless you use
their services. The integration of Google services into Android is phenomenal.
When you first turn on your device, you are asked to enter your Google account
information, and the device takes care of the rest. Your email, contacts,
calendar, Google Talk, etc. are set up automatically.&nbsp;Genius.</p>
