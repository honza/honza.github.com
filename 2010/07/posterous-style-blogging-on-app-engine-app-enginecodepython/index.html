<p>Posterous has been getting a lot of attention lately. Its simplicity appeals to
a wide range of users and more and more users are switching over from other
well-established blogging platforms such as Blogger or WordPress. In this
article, we will have a look at how you can replicate the Posterous
functionality on App Engine.</p>

<p>In case you don&rsquo;t know what Posterous is, it&rsquo;s very simple. It&rsquo;s a blogging
tool like Google&rsquo;s Bloggeror Wordpress.com. What makes it different from the
other services is its ridiculous simplicity. With Posterous, you don&rsquo;t need to
create an account. That&rsquo;s because you create new posts by emailing your post to
Posterous. It creates links for you, images sent as attachments will be
transformed into galleries, etc.</p>

<p>I like Posterous, but my website has a lot of custom programming on the
back-end so I&rsquo;m very hesitant to switch over. And besides, I like to know how
things work behind the scenes. I thought it might be fun to create a system
similar to Posterous&rsquo; for my own blog which is, of course, hosted on App
Engine.</p>

<p>Here is what we are going to do. I want to be able to send an email to my own
blog and have it turn it into a post and publish it to the blog.</p>

<p>OK, let&rsquo;s start with the post model:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">class Post(db.Model):
    title = db.StringProperty()
    body = db.TextProperty()
    added = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_now_add=True)
    author = db.StringProperty()
</code></pre>

<p>Very straight forward. You have your title, body, author and when the post was
published.</p>

<p>In order to enable incoming email, you need to add a couple of lines of code to
your <code>app.yaml</code> file. In addition to your regular handlers, add the
following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">inbound_services:
- mail

handlers:
- url: /_ah/mail/.+
  script: main.py
</code></pre>

<p>The first line enables incoming email for your application. The second part is
the important part. On App Engine, an incoming email message is processed as a
HTTP POST request. Since it&rsquo;s a regular HTTP request, we will need a handler
for it in the <code>app.yaml</code> file. You have several options here. You can create
a catch-all handler for all incoming email addresses (like I&rsquo;ve done above), or
create seperate handlers for different addresses.</p>

<p>The email address that we will use is in the following format:
<a href="mailto:your%5Fstring@appid.appspotmail.com">your_string@appid.appspotmail.com</a>. You should substitute the appid with your
app&rsquo;s ID. The string before the &lsquo;@&rsquo; symbol can be set to anything you want.</p>

<p>With this out of the way, we are ready to write the actual email handler. This
will go into your <code>main.py</code> file which you defined in the <code>app.yaml</code>.</p>

<p>First, some imports:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import email
from google.appengine.ext.webapp.mail_handlers import InboundMailHandler
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you add the following to the list of URL mappings in the instantiation of
the application class.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">application = webapp.WSGIApplication([
    ('/', Index),
    EmailHandler.mapping()
    ], debug=True)
</code></pre>

<p>Here EmailHandler is the request handler class that will handle the incoming
email. The <code>mapping()</code> method will map all of the addresses and send all of
them to this handler class. It&rsquo;s just a convenience method, no magic here.</p>

<p>Now, finally, onto the actual handler:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">class EmailHandler(InboundMailHandler):
    def receive(self, mail_message):
        post = Post()
        post.title = mail_message.subject
        for content_type, body in mail_message.bodies():
            post.body = body.decode()
        post.author = 'John Smith'
        post.put()
</code></pre>

<p>This is actually very simple. The incoming email message is saved in the
<code>mail_message</code> variable and you can access all of the usual email metadata as
its properties (e.g. mail_message.sender). So, we create a new post, take the
email&rsquo;s subject and set it as the post&rsquo;s title. The <code>bodies()</code> method
extracts the body of the email and the <code>decode()</code> function will decode the
actual body. Then we set the author and save the post in the datastore.</p>

<p>Often you will want to include a link in your post, or create a list. This is
easily accomplished with HTML tags. However, HTML tags are a pain, so you might
want to use something like Markdown.</p>

<p>Adding markdown support is super easy. Download the Python
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/python-markdown2/">Markdown library</a> and put the <code>markdown2.py</code> file in your app&rsquo;s root
directory. Then import it in your <code>main.py</code> file.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import markdown2
</code></pre>

<p>And change the following line:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">post.body = body.decode()
</code></pre>

<p>to this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">post.body = markdown2.markdown(body.decode())
</code></pre>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is a very simple yet effective technique and it will allow you to create
post from anywhere. I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed the post. Let me know if you have any
suggestions on how to improve it.</p>
