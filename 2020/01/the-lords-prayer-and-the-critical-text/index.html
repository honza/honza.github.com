  <p>Proponents of modern bible translations and the critical text in general argue
that the KJV should be abandoned for ecclesiastical use. The two main
arguments are (1) its archaic language, and (2) inferior Greek text.</p>
<p>Firstly, biblical doctrine is complex, and if we want to reach the world, we
should endeavor to remove as many obstacles as possible. The lowest hanging
fruit appears to be the translation of the bible. We want it to be as simple
as possible to facilitate faster understanding. The KJV is too archaic, and
hinders the modern person&rsquo;s ability to meditate on the Word of God. The KJV
obscures the bible.</p>
<p>Secondly, the KJV was produced at the beginning of the seventeenth century.
Since then, more New Testament manuscripts have been discovered. These
manuscripts, especially the papyri, are much older than the materials the KJV
translators used. We now have a better bible. We can remove verses that
aren&rsquo;t original; verses added by overzealous scribes either on purpose or by
accident.</p>
<p>We could discuss the merits of those two arguments. Instead, I&rsquo;d like to draw
your attention to the Lord&rsquo;s prayer. Meant as a template or a model for
prayer, it&rsquo;s nevertheless often recited corporately during worship as a means
to foster unity. In most cases, it&rsquo;s recited in its traditional rendering
which comes from the King James Version.</p>
<p><em>Our father, which art in heaven, hallowed by thy name</em></p>
<p>This is some seriously archaic language. What&rsquo;s more, however, is that the
prayer is concluded with</p>
<p><em>for thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen</em></p>
<p>The conclusion of the Lord&rsquo;s prayer is recorded in Matthew 6:13. This very
verse contains a significant textual variant which removes the conclusion of
the Lord&rsquo;s prayer. The oldest and supposedly best manuscripts omit this verse.
So, not only are we using archaic language, we are also using a disputed text.
I see this as an inconsistency on the part of modern translation proponents who
dismiss the KJV as being archaic, mock those who prefer it, and then continue
to use it in worship.</p>
