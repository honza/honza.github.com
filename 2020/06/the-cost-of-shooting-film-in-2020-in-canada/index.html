<p>At this point, there is no denying that film photography is enjoying a
widespread revival.</p>
<p>What I want to do in this article is to go through the costs associated with
shooting film in 2020, and specifically in Canada. There are many YouTube
videos and articles about film photography in Germany or in the United States
but not much is said about Canada. If you live in Canada, you know that prices
of goods can sometimes be significantly higher than in the US, and so this
should give you an idea of what you are getting yourself into.</p>
<p>We will consider black and white photography only. This is the cheaper option.
We will not discuss the cost of the camera used to capture these images.</p>
<p>We will talk about two types of film:</p>
<ul>
<li>35mm</li>
<li>120 (6x6 or 12 exposures)</li>
</ul>
<p>We will compare using a lab to develop your negatives versus doing it yourself.</p>
<p>We will have two types of photographers in mind: the documentary photographer,
and the obssessed photographer.</p>
<p>The documentary photographer photographs their family, special occassions, and
vacations. This photographer shoots one roll of film per month on average. (12
rolls per year, i.e. 432 frames of 35mm, or 144 frames of 120 film)</p>
<p>The obssessed photographer loves photography. They shoot almost every day.
Their bookshelf is full of photo books done by the masters. They have binders
full of negatives. This photographer shoots three rolls of film per month on
average. (36 rolls per year, i.e. 1296 frames of 35mm, or 432 frames of 120
film)</p>
<p>The film of choice is going to be <a href="https://www.ilfordphoto.com/hp5-plus-35mm">Ilford HP5 Plus 400</a>.</p>
<p>All of the costs in this article exclude sales tax.</p>
<h2 id="sourcing-film">Sourcing film</h2>
<p>When I first started looking into this, I assumed the cheapest option would be
some a Chinese seller on eBay. It turns out that Ilford actually has a
<a href="https://www.ilfordphoto.ca/">dedicated distributor in Canada</a>, and their products are readily available at
Canada-friendly prices.</p>
<p>35mm film:</p>
<ul>
<li>36 exposures, $8.67</li>
<li>24 exposures, $7.32</li>
<li>100ft of bulk, $110.51</li>
</ul>
<p>120 film:</p>
<ul>
<li>$7.67</li>
</ul>
<p>One hundred feet of bulk film is equivalent to 18 rolls of 36 exposures. This
is roughly $6.14 per roll, a saving of about 30%.  You will have to purchase a
bulk loader, and some reusable canisters; this is about $100 in total.</p>
<p><strong>Documentary photographer</strong>: there are two options, a) buy 12 36-exposure rolls
each year, or b) 2 100ft rolls of bulk film over 3 years.</p>
<ul>
<li>a) 8.67 * 12 * 3 = $312.10 (or $104.03 per year; $0.24 per frame)</li>
<li>b) 110.51 * 2 = $221.02 (or $73.67 per year; $0.17 per frame)</li>
</ul>
<p>If they decide to go with option b), they will also need to purchase bulk
loading equipment, but as you can see, the break-even point is very close to the
3-year mark.</p>
<p>If they shoot 120 film: $92.04 per year or $0.64 per frame.</p>
<p><strong>Obssessed photographer</strong>: bulk loading is certainly the way to go here. They
will save about $200 every year by loading their own film.  Film cost per year:
$221.02.</p>
<p>If they shoot 120 film: $276.12 per year or $0.64 per frame.</p>
<h2 id="developing-film-lab">Developing film &mdash; lab</h2>
<p>For our lab numbers, we will use <a href="http://canadianfilmlab.com/pricing-cad/">Canadian Film Lab</a>. For black and white
processing, you can get a roll of 35mm developed, scanned, and edited for $25;
120 film will run you $22 for the same. Let&rsquo;s add $5 for mailing it in.</p>
<h3 id="documentary-photographer">Documentary photographer</h3>
<ul>
<li>35mm: 12 * $30 = $360 per year ($0.83 per frame)</li>
<li>120: 12 * $27 = $324 per year ($2.25 per frame)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="obssessed-photographer">Obssessed photographer</h3>
<ul>
<li>35mm: 36 * $30 = $1,080 per year ($0.83 per frame)</li>
<li>120: 36 * $27 = $972 per year ($2.25 per frame)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="developing-film-at-home">Developing film &mdash; at home</h2>
<p>Developing black and white film at home is a relatively simple process. When
you are finished shooting a roll of film, you place it in a hard bag, remove it
from the canister (or spool), and wind it on a reel. The reel is then placed
into a light safe tank. This tank is really in that you can pour chemicals in
and out of it without exposing what&rsquo;s inside to light. This is called a
Paterson tank, and it can usually fit 2 rolls of 35mm film or 1 roll of 120 film
(there are other sizes, too). There are three chemicals that you have to pour
in one by one for certain periods of time: the developer, the stop bath, and the
fixer. Once your film is developed, you need to scan it, and for that you need
a scanner which has a backlight.</p>
<p>There are two types of purchases here: the one time purchase, and the ongoing
purchases of things that need to be replenished. While it may seem like a lot
of money up from, it all pays for itself in the long run when compared to using
a lab.</p>
<h3 id="one-time-cost">One time cost</h3>
<h4 id="paterson-tank">Paterson tank</h4>
<p>You can purchase one at <a href="https://www.patersonphotographic.ca/product/universal-tank-with-two-reels/">Paterson Canada</a> for $39.20. This one will fit either 2
rolls of 35mm film, or a single roll of 120 film.</p>
<h4 id="black-bag">Black bag</h4>
<p>You can purchase at one at <a href="https://www.patersonphotographic.ca/product/changing-bag-27x30/">Paterson Canada</a> for $56.00. You might be able to
find one cheaper on eBay or Amazon.</p>
<h4 id="scanner">Scanner</h4>
<p>You can find an Epson V660 scanner on <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/EPSON-B11B198011-Epson-Perfection-Scanner/dp/B072WC4QFB/">Amazon</a> for $399. You can find an older
Epson model for possibly half that.</p>
<h3 id="ongoing-cost">Ongoing cost</h3>
<p>After acquiring the necessary equipment, you will need to keep buying the
chemicals. There are three things you will need: developer, stop bath, and
fixer. We will buy all three of them from the Ilford Canada website (they offer
free shipping if you order over $100).</p>
<h4 id="developer">Developer</h4>
<p>Our developer of choice is <a href="https://www.ilfordphoto.ca/product/ilfosol-3-500ml-2/">Ilfosol 3</a>. It costs $13.10. It comes in 500ml
bottles. The liquid must be diluted before use with a ratio of 1:14. Our
Paterson tank has a volume of 500ml, and does either 2 rolls of 35mm film or 1
roll of 120 film. Given the ratio above, 35ml of Ilfosol 3 will yield one
Paterson tank batch. Thus, the 500ml bottle of developer should yield 14
batches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost per 35mm frame: $0.013</li>
<li>Cost per 120 frame: $0.078</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentary photographer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>35mm: one bottle should last at least two years; cost per year: $6.55</li>
<li>120: one bottle should last at least one year; cost per year: $13.10</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Obssessed photographer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>35mm: one and a half bottles: $19.65</li>
<li>120: three bottles: $39.30</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="stop-bath">Stop bath</h4>
<p>Our stop bath of choice is <a href="https://www.ilfordphoto.ca/product/ilfostop-500ml/">Ilford stop bath</a>. It costs $11.40. It comes in
500ml bottles. The liquid must be diluted before use with a ratio of 1:19. One
bottle should yield 20 batches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost per 35mm frame: $0.008</li>
<li>Cost per 120 frame: $0.048</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Documentary photographer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>35mm: one bottle should last at least three years; cost per year: $3.80</li>
<li>120: one bottle should last at least one year; cost per year: $11.40</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Obssessed photographer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>35mm: one bottle: $11.40</li>
<li>120: one bottle: $11.40</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="fixer">Fixer</h4>
<p>Our fixer of choice is <a href="https://www.ilfordphoto.ca/product/rapid-fixer-500ml/">Ilford Rapid Fixer</a>. It costs $10.47. It comes in 500ml
bottles. The liquid must be diluted before use with a ratio of 1:4. One bottle
should yield 5 batches. The liquid can be reused 24 times. One bottle will
yield 120 Paterson tank batches.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost per 35mm frame: $0.001</li>
<li>Cost per 120 frame: $0.007</li>
</ul>
<p>Compared to the other items, the cost of fixer is negligible.</p>
<h4 id="total-chemicals">Total chemicals</h4>
<p><strong>Documentary photographer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>35mm: $10.35 per year</li>
<li>120: $24.50 per year</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Obssessed photographer</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>35mm: $31.05 per year</li>
<li>120: $50.70 per year</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="let-s-put-it-all-together">Let&rsquo;s put it all together</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put all the numbers together. Since developing film at home involves some
startup costs, we will indicate how much each photographer spends per year for
the first 5 years, and then we will do some averages.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We have seen a lot of numbers. The biggest take away is that developing film at
home can significantly reduce your costs if you shoot a lot. However, the
biggest downside to developing your own film is that there is a lot stuff you
need to buy up front. Some people may not enjoy the developing process, and the
higher cost of having someone else deal with it might be worth it. Also, bulk
loading your film can save you a ton of money, too.</p>
