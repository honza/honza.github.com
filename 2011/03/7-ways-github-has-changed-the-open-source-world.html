<h3>7 ways Github has changed the open source&nbsp;world</h3>
<p>As the guys at <a class="reference external" href="http://thechangelog.com">the changelog</a> say, the world of open source is changing fast
and you have to keep up. I believe that Github has been very in&#xFB02;uential when
it comes to making open source more accessible. How has Github changed the
world of open&nbsp;source?</p>
<div class="section" id="force-projects-to-include-a-good-readme">
<h4>Force projects to include a good&nbsp;<span class="caps">README</span></h4>
<p>Apart from the directory structure and &#xFB01;les, the most prominent element on the
page is your <span class="caps">README</span> &#xFB01;le. If you don&#8217;t have one, the page looks kind of weird. As
an administrator, if you don&#8217;t add a <span class="caps">README</span> &#xFB01;le, Github will start yelling at&nbsp;you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="uni&#xFB01;ed-place-for-all-your-projects">
<h4>Uni&#xFB01;ed place for all your&nbsp;projects</h4>
<p>When I come across a cool project, I like to see what other stuff the author
has been hacking on. The best example I think is <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/tpope">tpope</a> who is a famous
vim plugin creator. When you go to his pro&#xFB01;le page on Github, you can see all
of the plugins he has ever written and&nbsp;published.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-discussions">
<h4>Code&nbsp;discussions</h4>
<p>Yes, you can discuss the project on <span class="caps">IRC</span> or on mailing lists. Those aren&#8217;t
exactly user friendly, and it&#8217;s hard to discuss code that way. Github makes it
easy for you to submit a pull request and have others comment on your&nbsp;code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="publish-your-hacks-with-ease">
<h4>Publish your hacks with&nbsp;ease</h4>
<p>Did you just write a patch that greatly improves an existing project? Fork it
and publish it in minutes. If you notify the original project, you can get
helpful feedback on your hacks. This encourages people to publish their code
even if it&#8217;s never merged into the original&nbsp;project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="judge-how-active-a-project-is">
<h4>Judge how active a project&nbsp;is</h4>
<p>Github makes it easy to quickly look through a project&#8217;s history to see how
active it is. In no time, you can tell how many people commit to it and how
often. Also, the number of watchers/forks in the corner gives you a pretty good
idea of how many people are actually using the project. This is possibly my
favorite feature. Open source developers don&#8217;t need to waste their time
exploring libraries that aren&#8217;t&nbsp;maintained.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="discover-new-projects">
<h4>Discover new&nbsp;projects</h4>
<p>Smart people come up with clever things all the time. If they share their code
on Github, you can &#xFB01;nd it in the Explore Github section. I can&#8217;t remember how
many times I&#8217;ve discovered a cool project this way. My favorite example is
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script">CoffeeScript</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="follow-the-development-of-your-favorite-projects">
<h4>Follow the development of your favorite&nbsp;projects</h4>
<p>When you &#xFB01;rst log in, you are presented with a list of changes that were made
to the projects you follow. This projects has a new release, this bug was
&#xFB01;xed. etc.&nbsp;Invaluable.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts? Any favorite features of&nbsp;Github?</p>
