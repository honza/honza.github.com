 For computer programmers, especially if you&rsquo;re self-employed, there&rsquo;s no excuse whatsoever not to get the latest and greatest. You don&rsquo;t really have other expenses anyway, it&rsquo;s tax-deductible and, most importantly, it will make you happy and more productive if you know that you&rsquo;re using the best available tools."/>

  <p>I just found an interesting quote by <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/">Thomas Fuchs</a>, the creator of
script.aculo.us and a core member of the Prototype team. The quote is from his
<a href="http://thomas.fuchs.usesthis.com/">Setup</a> interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For computer programmers, especially if you&rsquo;re self-employed, there&rsquo;s no
excuse whatsoever not to get the latest and greatest. You don&rsquo;t really have
other expenses anyway, it&rsquo;s tax-deductible and, most importantly, it will
make you happy and more productive if you know that you&rsquo;re using the best
available tools.</p>

<p>Do you agree?</p>
