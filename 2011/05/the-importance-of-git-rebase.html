<h1>The importance of git&nbsp;rebase</h1>
<p>Git isn&#8217;t just something you have to put up with when working with other
developers. Git is a wonderful tool that allows you to manage your code, its
evolution and help you recover from mistakes should they arise. One of the
things that people are intimidated by is <tt class="docutils literal">git rebase</tt>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example. You&#8217;re working on a team with two other developers.
You have a blessed repository that sits on your company&#8217;s server. Everyone is
working on the same project but on slightly different tasks. Everyone is
working on the master branch. You write a bit of code here and there, you
commit a bunch of times and then it&#8217;s time to share your code with the rest of
the team by pushing it up to the shared&nbsp;repository.</p>
<p>You run <tt class="docutils literal">git push</tt> but receive an error saying that there are changes on the
server and your commit cannot be fast-forwarded. No big deal, right? You run
<tt class="docutils literal">git pull</tt> to download the changes that you don&#8217;t have and automatically
merge your changes in. Then you can <tt class="docutils literal">git push</tt> again and it will work just&nbsp;fine.</p>
<p>The problem is that it makes the history of your project&nbsp;messy.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">* 9:35 - Nancy - Merge branch &#39;master&#39;</span>
<span class="go">|\</span>
<span class="go">* | 9:35 - Nancy - Second commit</span>
<span class="go">| |</span>
<span class="go">| * 9:30 - Brad - First commit</span>
<span class="go">|/</span>
<span class="go">* 9:12 - Nancy - First commit</span>
</pre></div>
<p>As you can see, there is this strange <strong>Merge branch &#8216;master&#8217;</strong> commit that&#8217;s a
little out of place. If everyone on your team is regularly pushing to the
shared repository, the history gets littered with these weird commits pretty&nbsp;quickly.</p>
<p>You may have guessed that there is a better way. We&#8217;ll replay the above
scenario using <tt class="docutils literal">git rebase</tt>. Instead of running <cite>git pull</cite>, we will run <tt class="docutils literal">git
pull <span class="pre">&#8211;rebase</span></tt>. What this will do is temporarily hide the commits that only you
have, then pull the changes from the remote repository, fast-forward (no merge
commit) and then re-apply your commits on top of the current <span class="caps">HEAD</span>. The end
result from a code point of view is the same, but the history is much&nbsp;cleaner:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="go">* 9:35 - Nancy - Second commit</span>
<span class="go">* 9:30 - Brad - First commit</span>
<span class="go">* 9:12 - Nancy - First commit</span>
</pre></div>
<p>See? Isn&#8217;t this so much better? The only difference to your current workflow is
that instead of <tt class="docutils literal">git pull</tt> you will run <tt class="docutils literal">git pull <span class="pre">&#8211;rebase</span></tt>.&nbsp;Easy!</p>
