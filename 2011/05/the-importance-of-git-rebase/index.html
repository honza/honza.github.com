  <p>Git isn&rsquo;t just something you have to put up with when working with other
developers. Git is a wonderful tool that allows you to manage your code, its
evolution and help you recover from mistakes should they arise. One of the
things that people are intimidated by is <code>git rebase</code>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s look at an example. You&rsquo;re working on a team with two other developers.
You have a blessed repository that sits on your company&rsquo;s server. Everyone is
working on the same project but on slightly different tasks. Everyone is
working on the master branch. You write a bit of code here and there, you
commit a bunch of times and then it&rsquo;s time to share your code with the rest of
the team by pushing it up to the shared repository.</p>
<p>You run <code>git push</code> but receive an error saying that there are changes on the
server and your commit cannot be fast-forwarded. No big deal, right? You run
<code>git pull</code> to download the changes that you don&rsquo;t have and automatically
merge your changes in. Then you can <code>git push</code> again and it will work just
fine.</p>
<p>The problem is that it makes the history of your project messy.</p>
