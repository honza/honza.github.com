  <p>I love talking about scalability. Everyone has their own opinion, their own way
of performing benchmarks and their own conclusions. And we all know that this
is <em>very</em> silly. I recently came across an article by <a href="http://twitter.com/dozba">Ted Dziuba</a> that
summarizes it very nicely for you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shut up about scalability, no one is using your app anyway.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I love how the author explains the use of the word <em>scalability</em> in this day
and age:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most common butthurt about scalability is this: choose a technology. If
you like the technology, claim &ldquo;technology X scales better!&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t
like it, claim &ldquo;technology X doesn&rsquo;t scale!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
