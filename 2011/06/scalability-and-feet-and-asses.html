<h1>Scalability and feet and&nbsp;asses</h1>
<p>I love talking about scalability. Everyone has their own opinion, their own way
of performing benchmarks and their own conclusions. And we all know that this
is <em>very</em> silly. I recently came across an article by <a class="reference external" href="http://twitter.com/dozba">Ted Dziuba</a> that
summarizes it very nicely for&nbsp;you:</p>
<blockquote>
Shut up about scalability, no one is using your app anyway.</blockquote>
<p>I love how the author explains the use of the word <em>scalability</em> in this day
and&nbsp;age:</p>
<blockquote>
The most common butthurt about scalability is this: choose a technology. If
you like the technology, claim &#8220;technology X scales better!&#8221; If you don&#8217;t
like it, claim &#8220;technology X doesn&#8217;t scale!&#8221;</blockquote>
<p>You can find the article <a class="reference external" href="http://teddziuba.com/2008/04/im-going-to-scale-my-foot-up-y.html">here</a>.</p>
