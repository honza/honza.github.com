<h1>Why I don&#8217;t like the Ruby&nbsp;community</h1>
<p>I write Python and Javascript code. I use Django and jQuery. And I cringe every
time I have to run <tt class="docutils literal">gem install x</tt>. I only have a limited understanding of
Ruby and hardly any of Ruby on Rails. It seems disorganized to me and hard to
process. All this is fine &#8211; I don&#8217;t have to use any of it if I don&#8217;t like it,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>I always knew there was something wrong with the way Ruby works. I don&#8217;t mean
wrong like murdering children, I just mean wrong like I don&#8217;t know why things
are the way they are. There are a lot of talented Ruby programmers and I don&#8217;t
mean to dismiss&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Recently, though, I came across a tweet that I made me realize what it was that
I didn&#8217;t like about Ruby. It was like a small&nbsp;revelation.</p>
<blockquote>
Markup is markup, not Ruby. JavaScript is JavaScript, not Ruby. <span class="caps">CSS</span> is <span class="caps">CSS</span>,
not Ruby. Get that in your head before I slap you. - <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/#!/ara_p/status/81425173965832193">&#64;ara_p</a></blockquote>
<p>Do you get it? <a class="reference external" href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html"><span class="caps">ERB</span></a> is Ruby with some html-like fragments mixed in.
<a class="reference external" href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> is a Ruby-like language that compiles to Javascript. <a class="reference external" href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> is
a Ruby-like language for writing css&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>Before you know it, everything will be in&nbsp;Ruby.</p>
