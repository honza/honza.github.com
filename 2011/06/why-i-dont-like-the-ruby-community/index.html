  <p>I write Python and Javascript code. I use Django and jQuery. And I cringe every
time I have to run <code>gem install x</code>. I only have a limited understanding of
Ruby and hardly any of Ruby on Rails. It seems disorganized to me and hard to
process. All this is fine &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have to use any of it if I don&rsquo;t like it,
right?</p>

<p>I always knew there was something wrong with the way Ruby works. I don&rsquo;t mean
wrong like murdering children, I just mean wrong like I don&rsquo;t know why things
are the way they are. There are a lot of talented Ruby programmers and I don&rsquo;t
mean to dismiss that.</p>

<p>Recently, though, I came across a tweet that I made me realize what it was that
I didn&rsquo;t like about Ruby. It was like a small revelation.</p>

<p>Markup is markup, not Ruby. JavaScript is JavaScript, not Ruby. CSS is CSS,
not Ruby. Get that in your head before I slap you. - <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ara%5Fp/status/81425173965832193">@ara_p</a></p>

<p>Do you get it? <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html">ERB</a> is Ruby with some html-like fragments mixed in.
<a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> is a Ruby-like language that compiles to Javascript. <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> is
a Ruby-like language for writing css files.</p>

<p>Before you know it, everything will be in Ruby.</p>
