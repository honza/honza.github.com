<h1>Google APIs - Y U <span class="caps">NO</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">WORK</span></h1>
<p>Recently, at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sheepdoginc.ca">SheepDogInc</a>, I have been working with various Google APIs,
especially the Calendar <span class="caps">API</span>. The state of these APIs is rather <em>unfortunate</em>.
Google is a web giant and you&#8217;d think that their APIs would be state-of-the-art
given the number of professionals they&nbsp;employ.</p>
<div class="section" id="documentation">
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>Before we go anywhere, let me just talk about the documentation for a minute.
As an open-source software author and advocate, I always encourage developers
to write extensive and good documentation. Somehow, Google didn&#8217;t get the demo.
Most of their documentation is sparse, incorrect and out-of-date. If you would
like to know what data a call returns, you&#8217;re better off just making the call
and inspecting the response. This will actually save you time because the docs
are probably wrong&nbsp;anyway.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reliability">
<h2>Reliability</h2>
<p>Google is like the master of scalability. They have an estimated one million
servers world-wide. And yet, they cannot consistently return a 200 to an <span class="caps">API</span>
call. I have written horrible, horrible glue code and hacky workarounds to
account for this unpredictability. Sometimes you will get a response, sometimes
it will timeout, sometime you will get a&nbsp;404&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="engineering">
<h2>Engineering</h2>
<p>With all these amazing engineers, can Google really not make a better <span class="caps">API</span>?
Honestly, if I was in a position to hire a person who worked on the Google <span class="caps">API</span>
team, I would think twice. Seriously &#8212; test your app, keep your docs
up-to-date, and mainly, stop pissing me&nbsp;off!</p>
