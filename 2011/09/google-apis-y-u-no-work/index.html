<article>
  

<p>Recently, at <a href="http://www.sheepdoginc.ca">SheepDogInc</a>, I have been working with various Google APIs,
especially the Calendar API. The state of these APIs is rather <em>unfortunate</em>.
Google is a web giant and you&rsquo;d think that their APIs would be state-of-the-art
given the number of professionals they employ.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>Before we go anywhere, let me just talk about the documentation for a minute.
As an open-source software author and advocate, I always encourage developers
to write extensive and good documentation. Somehow, Google didn&rsquo;t get the demo.
Most of their documentation is sparse, incorrect and out-of-date. If you would
like to know what data a call returns, you&rsquo;re better off just making the call
and inspecting the response. This will actually save you time because the docs
are probably wrong anyway.</p>

<h2 id="reliability">Reliability</h2>

<p>Google is like the master of scalability. They have an estimated one million
servers world-wide. And yet, they cannot consistently return a 200 to an API
call. I have written horrible, horrible glue code and hacky workarounds to
account for this unpredictability. Sometimes you will get a response, sometimes
it will timeout, sometime you will get a 404&hellip;</p>

<h2 id="engineering">Engineering</h2>

<p>With all these amazing engineers, can Google really not make a better API?
Honestly, if I was in a position to hire a person who worked on the Google API
team, I would think twice. Seriously &mdash; test your app, keep your docs
up-to-date, and mainly, stop pissing me off!</p>
