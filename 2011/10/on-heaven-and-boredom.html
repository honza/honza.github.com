<h1>On heaven and&nbsp;boredom</h1>
<p>One of the complaints many atheists raise against becoming a Christian is the
fact that heaven will be boring. They have in their minds this idea of us in
heaven as chubby toddlers in diapers playing harps and flying around. To me
that would be&nbsp;hell.</p>
<p>I would like to talk to you about why I think that heaven won&#8217;t be boring. Let
me start by telling you a how my high school teacher explained to us the
concept of geometric parallels. She said they were two lines that didn&#8217;t
intersect or touch. She also made a side note that the two parallels will
intersect at one specific point, being&nbsp;infinity.</p>
<p>It takes the two parallel lines all of infinity to reach each other. Now, keep
that in mind while we look at some&nbsp;Scripture.</p>
<blockquote>
Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and
they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. &#8211;
Revelation 21:3, <span class="caps">ESV</span></blockquote>
<p>The Bible says that God will live with us, among us, so we can know Him fully.
God is omnipotent, omniscient and infinite. To comprehend all of the depths of
God, all his wisdom, love and grace, we will need a long&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>How long? Well, it&#8217;s easy. Exactly <em>one eternity</em>.</p>
