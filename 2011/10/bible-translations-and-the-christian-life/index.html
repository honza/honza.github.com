<p>There are many English translations of the Bible. They were all made for
different audiences. They employ different translation techniques. Each
Christian celebrity endorses a different translation.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that a certain Bible translation can be elevated to
such a degree that the common believer is made to believe that the translation
contains actual words of God. You need to realize that a translation is just
that: a translation. No matter how many scholars with the best schools you
commission to create this new, true translation of the Scriptures, it is bound
to be imperfect in some way. One language cannot accurately convey the same
meaning as an another. Each language carries with it a certain culture, sense
of humor and ways of expressing common idioms.</p>

<p>This is perhaps a little hard to understand if you only speak one language. If
you have had to learn English and you moved to foreign country, this idea may
be clearer to you.</p>

<p>So, where do you go from here? As you may know, the Bible was written in three
languages: Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek. As Christians, we focus most of our
attention on the New Testament which is written in Greek.</p>

<p>I am going to suggest that if you are even remotely interested in serious study
of the Word of God that you invest a few years of your life and learn New
Testament Greek. Now you are thinking that I&rsquo;m completely crazy. Bear with me
for a moment.</p>

<p>The vocabulary of the New Testament is final. You don&rsquo;t need to learn words
like <em>airplane</em>, <em>computer</em> or <em>email</em>. If you learn only 300 Greek words, you
will understand over 80% of the New Testament; double the amount and you will
get up to 90%. I&rsquo;m confident that after a year of casual study of Greek you can
begin to read some of the simpler passages (like 1 John). After another year,
you will read Paul&rsquo;s writing without much hindrance.</p>

<p>After 3-4 years, you will be ready to abandon reading the New Testament in
English altogether. Let that sink in.</p>

<p>There are plenty of good resource for learning New Testament Greek. Both online
and in print.</p>

<p>One last thing: if you are in your twenties or event thirties and you expect to
be alive for another 50-60 years, wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good investment to spend a
few years learning the language Paul, Luke, John and others spoke and wrote in?</p>
