<h1>Android Development&nbsp;disappointments</h1>
<p>The Android platform is the latest buzz in the smartphone world. I have
previously written on why I prefer Android over iPhone. In this article, we
will talk a little bit about what it&#8217;s like to develop native applications for&nbsp;Android.</p>
<p>Android <span class="caps">SDK</span> uses Java. I know Java but it&#8217;s not my favorite. After working with
Python and Django for months, going back to Java isn&#8217;t exactly easy. But it&#8217;s
not undoable&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>Being from the Czech republic, I thought I would try to target the Czech
market. Android is starting to get really big over there. I decided to write a
simple news reader application for one of the leading news portals called iDnes
(&#8220;eToday&#8221;). The application downloads an <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed, parses it and displays a
list of news articles to the user. The user has the option to choose their
topic, and to manually refresh the application to get new&nbsp;articles.</p>
<p>Not very complicated at all. It took me a few evenings to put it together. The
development process was quite fun. The Android <span class="caps">SDK</span> integration into Eclipse is
awesome. It tells you when you have to implement additional methods, or
automatically adds your imports when it&#8217;s needed. As part of the <span class="caps">SDK</span>, you get a
simulator for all kinds of versions of Android (from 1.5 to 2.2). This way, you
can test your application on various versions of the&nbsp;<span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
<p>I read all the articles on packaging and distributing. I made sure my
application was backwards compatible. I tried to follow their guidelines for
app icons as much as I could (well, I suck at graphic design). I exported the
applications, signed it, aligned it and uploaded it to the Android&nbsp;Market.</p>
<p>I was excited. I did it. I published my first Android applications. But then
came the&nbsp;disappointment.</p>
<p>My app started to get a lot of bad comments in the market. People complained
that the application didn&#8217;t do anything, and they couldn&#8217;t read any news, etc.
I didn&#8217;t come across any errors like that during testing. If the applications
doesn&#8217;t have internet, it will tell the user it doesn&#8217;t have internet. If there
is a problem, it will let them&nbsp;know.</p>
<p>As a developer and author, I feel there is no way for me to receive helpful
information about the errors the users are getting when they are interacting
with the&nbsp;application.</p>
<p><span class="caps">OK</span>, that&#8217;s it. If you have any comments or suggestions, do let me know in the&nbsp;comments.</p>
