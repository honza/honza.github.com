<h1>What is a&nbsp;blog?</h1>
<p>I have noticed that many people don&#8217;t know what a blog is, so I would like to
talk about that&nbsp;briefly.</p>
<blockquote>
A blog is a type of website or part of a website. Blogs are usually
maintained by an individual with regular entries. (&#8230;) Entries are
commonly displayed in reverse-chronological order. Blog can also be used as
a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog. Source: <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">Wikipedia</a></blockquote>
<p>A blog is a website. A blog has many <em>entries</em> or <em>posts</em>. To write a post
means to update your existing blog with a new article. To create or write a new
blog means to start a new&nbsp;website.</p>
<p>Please, don&#8217;t say that you are going write a blog when you mean you will write
a post. That would be wrong.&nbsp;<span class="caps">OK</span>?</p>
