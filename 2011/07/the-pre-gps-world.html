<h3>The pre-<span class="caps">GPS</span>&nbsp;world</h3>
<p>When I was a kid, our family used to travel a lot. I grew up in central Europe
and over the years, we visited most of continental Europe. This was in the
early &#8216;90s. Usually, Mom would have a map on her lap and she would tell Dad
where to go. To keep me and my little brother entertained, they gave us another
map and we would follow&nbsp;along.</p>
<p>We had fun trying to pronounce funny city names and calculating distances that
we had travelled that day. Mostly, we had fun travelling in the car. Sometimes,
we would get lost though and tension in the car would rise. My brother and I
were always trying to help get us <em>unlost</em>. I remember thinking that it would
be so cool to have a tiny little car on the map to show you where you were so
you&#8217;d always know where you were&nbsp;going.</p>
<p>Now, some &#xFB01;fteen years later, <span class="caps">GPS</span> units are very common. A dream come&nbsp;true?</p>
