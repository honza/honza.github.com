<h1>Single vs Many Programming&nbsp;Languages</h1>
<p>Junior programmers will often ask, &#8220;Which language should I use?&#8221;, &#8220;Which
programming language is the best?&#8221;, and when they discover this new hip
programming language that&#8217;s meant to solve all of their scaling problems, they
get in your face and mock you for not using it for every single task.  They
will write blog posts titled &#8220;X language for Y programmers&#8221; in hopes of
converting the masses to their newfound&nbsp;toy.</p>
<p>Smug senior programmers will laugh at the junior programmers and say that you
should learn a great many different languages to expand your horizons.  A
single language cannot possibly suffice in this day and age.  Each language has
its own set of libraries, each is better suited for a particular task.
Learning new languages will make you a better developer overall.  Plus,
marketing yourself as an X language developer limits your choice of&nbsp;employer.</p>
<p>Business people will have yet another approach.  Their product is obviously
written in some language or another so they <em>need</em> developer who can speak that
language.  Their platform is growing like crazy so they put up job posts
screaming &#8220;X language developer needed!&#8221;.  This creates a perceived demand for
a certain kind of developer.  Developer will start to feel the need to learn
this newly popular technology and start by reading a &#8220;X language for Y
programmers&#8221; post and thus completing the&nbsp;circle.</p>
