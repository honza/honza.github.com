  <h1>Single vs Many Programming Languages</h1>

</div>

<article>
  <p>Junior programmers will often ask, &ldquo;Which language should I use?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Which
programming language is the best?&ldquo;, and when they discover this new hip
programming language that&rsquo;s meant to solve all of their scaling problems, they
get in your face and mock you for not using it for every single task.  They
will write blog posts titled &ldquo;X language for Y programmers&rdquo; in hopes of
converting the masses to their newfound toy.</p>

<p>Smug senior programmers will laugh at the junior programmers and say that you
should learn a great many different languages to expand your horizons.  A
single language cannot possibly suffice in this day and age.  Each language has
its own set of libraries, each is better suited for a particular task.
Learning new languages will make you a better developer overall.  Plus,
marketing yourself as an X language developer limits your choice of employer.</p>

<p>Business people will have yet another approach.  Their product is obviously
written in some language or another so they <em>need</em> developer who can speak that
language.  Their platform is growing like crazy so they put up job posts
screaming &ldquo;X language developer needed!&rdquo;.  This creates a perceived demand for
a certain kind of developer.  Developer will start to feel the need to learn
this newly popular technology and start by reading a &ldquo;X language for Y
programmers&rdquo; post and thus completing the circle.</p>
