The Oatmeal has an awesome <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://theoatmeal.com/comics/apple\">comic</a> about\nthis. Being all crazy and sleeping on the sidewalk aside, let&#8217;s look at more of\na down-to-earth&nbsp;example.</p>\n<p>Being a geek and all, I get asked rather often if I would recommend someone\nbuys a Mac laptop. While I wholeheartadly agree that the Unix-like qualities of\nMac <span class=\"caps\">OSX</span> are infinitely superior to the (non) qualities of the Windows kernel, I\ncannot recommend to my friends that they buy a laptop with an apple on&nbsp;it.</p>\n<p>Here is&nbsp;why.</p>\n<p>I went on the <cite>FutureShop</cite> website to see what brand new laptops cost these\ndays and how powerful they&nbsp;are.</p>\n<p>First, I looked up the cheapest 15&#8217; <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://www.futureshop.ca/en-CA/product/apple-apple-macbook-pro-15-4-intel-core-i5-2-53ghz-laptop-english-mc372ll-a/10144050.aspx?path=d60135943742891f1c13c3119725be53en02\">Macbook Pro</a>. Here are the&nbsp;specs:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>Intel Core i5&nbsp;2.53GHz</li>\n<li><span class=\"caps\">4GB</span>&nbsp;<span class=\"caps\">RAM</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"caps\">500GB</span>&nbsp;<span class=\"caps\">HDD</span></li>\n<li>Intel <span class=\"caps\">HD</span> Graphics&nbsp;Card</li>\n<li>Price:&nbsp;$1,699.95</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then, I looked for a solid laptop that could compete with the Macbook Pro. I\ndidn&#8217;t want to compare it to laptops of questionable quality like those made by\nAcer or <span class=\"caps\">HP</span>. I went for a <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://www.futureshop.ca/en-CA/product/sony-sony-vaio-15-5-intel-core-i5-460m-laptop-vpceb37fdw-white-vpceb37fdw/10156213.aspx?path=b3cc400131894855a015719f00cd1728en02\">Sony Vaio</a>:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>Intel Core i5&nbsp;2.53GHz</li>\n<li><span class=\"caps\">4GB</span>&nbsp;<span class=\"caps\">RAM</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"caps\">500GB</span>&nbsp;<span class=\"caps\">HDD</span></li>\n<li>Intel <span class=\"caps\">HD</span> Graphics&nbsp;Card</li>\n<li>Price:&nbsp;$899</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m sure you will have noticed that the two computers have the exact same specs.\nHowever, the Macbook is almost <em>double</em> the price. I say, buy the Vaio and\ninstall Ubuntu on it. Rock solid laptop with a rock solid <span class=\"caps\">OS</span>. You can also buy\nyour wife a netbook or an iPad with the money you&nbsp;save.</p>\n<p>Let the flaming&nbsp;begin.</p>\n</div>\n",
