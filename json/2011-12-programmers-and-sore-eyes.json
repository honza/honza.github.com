When you stare at an <span class=\"caps\">LCD</span> screen all day long, the blink interval gets\nlarger. As a result, your eyes become dry and sore. This is further worsened by\ncoffee. Drinking lots of water and using over-the-counter drops will help. This\nis what my eye doctor told me&nbsp;yesterday.</p>\n</div>\n",
