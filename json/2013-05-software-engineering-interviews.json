You come to the office for an interview, spend a few\nminutes talking about the job and you, and then the inevitable hits:\nprogramming puzzles and quizzes.  You are asked to solve nonsensical,\nirrelevant, theoretical problems on the spot while the interviewer waits.\nThese problems in no way represent the actual work for which you\u2019re&nbsp;interviewing.</p>\n<p>How do you detect a palindrome?  What is the worst-case performance of the\nquicksort algorithm?  How do you find depth of a binary tree?  These are all\nutter nonsense.  If your cutting-edge application needs to detect palindromes,\nI\u2019m pretty sure you have bigger problems than you think.  All of these can be\neasily solved after a few minutes of research on the&nbsp;Internet.</p>\n<p>I get especially annoyed at these things because my mind doesn\u2019t work well in\nthis area.  I don\u2019t like to solve unrealistic problems.  My nonsense detector\nkicks in and I can\u2019t concentrate.  Instead, ask me if I know how to debug\nmessaging queue issues, how I like to set up a new server, how I like to run my\nDjango apps, how I\u2019d solve a specific problem you\u2019re having, etc.  Have me work\non your product alongside someone in your company.  Get to know me.  I can\nprogram.  I\u2019m good at what I do.  I\u2019m just not good at those stupid&nbsp;puzzles.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s not that I don&#8217;t like to think.  I\u2019m learning Haskell and I think I have\nunderstood monads (don\u2019t ask me to explain them to you though).  I like parsers\nand parser combinators.  That stuff is hard to understand and takes some serious\nalone time to&nbsp;grok.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure you can find a person out there who is the inverse of me.  They love\npuzzles and excel at them.  They get to the final round of Google Jam.  I\ndon\u2019t. Not even close.  But they are terrible programmers.  Who would you\nrather hire?  Every now and then I get this idea that I\u2019ll go and learn a whole\nbunch of puzzles and quizzes so I can wow the next interviewer.  But then I\ninevitably start to feel dishonest and drop the whole&nbsp;thing.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"how-to-interview-someone\">\n<h2>How to interview&nbsp;someone</h2>\n<p>Find a small problem in your code base.  Give them access to your Git\nrepository.  Assign the ticket to them.  Explain why it\u2019s a problem and suggest\na few possible solutions.  Have them work on it either alone or alongside one\nof your developers.  This gives your team the chance to get to know this\npotential hire and see if they would be a good fit.  This is how I interviewed\nat Amara and it was&nbsp;great.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d like to end with a brilliant <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/holman/status/154986236640112641\">Zach Holman</a> quote on&nbsp;interview:</p>\n<blockquote>\nI think programming riddles, games, and brain teasers are a great way to\nhire. First one to say &#8220;fuck this&#8221; and walk out gets the job.</blockquote>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
