People write code for free and\nmake it available for free for anyone to use. If you write a quick little\nprogram on the weekend, it&#8217;s usually because there is a need that has to be\nfilled. There&#8217;s a repetitive task that you wish you didn&#8217;t have to do so you\nwrite a short program to do it for&nbsp;you.</p>\n<p>Web development can be hard. You have to worry about your database, your\nserver-side code, your client-side templates and javascript and it all has to\nmagically work together. We web developers have created a ton of tools to help\nus get the job done. And those of us who are really commited to the best and\nmost reliable software make what we create in our spare time available for\neveryone else to use. We share the awesome idea we had in hopes that someone\nhad the same problem and we could help them solve it. Massive projects like\nDjango and Ruby on Rails come to mind. jQuery and Prototype. Fabric and\nCapistrano. The list just goes&nbsp;on.</p>\n<p>The world of open source is full of wonders. All of this is possible by\nreleasing our code under a license. And not just any license. If you were to\npublish your code online without describing how it can be used, by default you\nare reserving all the rights to yourself. Nobody else can legally use it. You\nas the creator have the right and responsibility to decide how your code will\nbe&nbsp;used.</p>\n<p>I was introduced to the world of open source by Linux and the <span class=\"caps\">GNU</span> movement. For\nthe longest time, I would claim that the only true open source license is the\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html\"><span class=\"caps\">GPL</span></a>. It&#8217;s a great license. It ensures that your software will never be used\nin a non-free way (free as in freedom). It works great for medium to large\nscale pieces of software, such as the Linux kernel or git. The two are self\ncontained and don&#8217;t usually have any&nbsp;dependencies.</p>\n<p>However, the more I moved from desktop software development towards developing\nfor the web, the more I found myself frustrated and confused by the <span class=\"caps\">GPL</span>. If a\nuser downloads a web page generated by a <span class=\"caps\">GPL</span>-covered web framework, do I need\nto also make available to the user the code that generated the page? If I use\njQuery on my page (which is released under the <span class=\"caps\">GPL</span>) and my scripts use it, do I\nhave to provide non-minified versions of my scripts? Can I legally use a\n<span class=\"caps\">GPL</span>-covered web framework to build a website for client and not make the source\ncode&nbsp;available?</p>\n<p>There are plenty more options to think about and my head starts to hurt every\ntime I try to make a sense of it&nbsp;all.</p>\n<p>I believe that the General Public License is <em>unsuitable</em> for web-based\nprojects such as web frameworks, javascript libraries, etc. In a modern web\napplication, there are way too many moving parts created by different parties.\nIt&#8217;s the web developer&#8217;s job to find the best tools to get their job done. I\nbelieve that the best tools available today are of the open source variety\n(<span class=\"caps\">MS</span> <span class=\"caps\">SQL</span> server,&nbsp;anyone?).</p>\n<p>I was reading Jeff Atwood&#8217;s <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/pick-a-license-any-license.html\">article</a> on software licenses and became\nconvinced that I should abandon the <span class=\"caps\">GPL</span> for my projects. After all, I want\npeople to use my software and making them try and understand the intricacies of\nthe legal language of the <span class=\"caps\">GPL</span> is unnecessary. Starting today, I will make my\nprojects available under the terms of a more permissive license. My current\nfavorites&nbsp;are:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license\"><span class=\"caps\">BSD</span></a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\"><span class=\"caps\">MIT</span></a></li>\n<li><a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://sam.zoy.org/wtfpl/\"><span class=\"caps\">WTFPL</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>They are all short and easy to understand. Peoples&#8217; time is expensive, let&#8217;s\nnot waste&nbsp;it.</p>\n<p>If you are a developer and you maintain a project that&#8217;s useful for making the\nweb a better place, I would ask that you consider using a permissive license\nfor your&nbsp;project.</p>\n<p><strong>Update (2012-01-09):</strong> After reading Van Lindberg&#8217;s <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517960.do\">book</a> on Open source\nlicenses, I have learned that the <span class=\"caps\">WTFPL</span> isn&#8217;t a good idea. It doesn&#8217;t actually\ndo anything in terms of legal protection or&nbsp;warranty.</p>\n</div>\n",
