The\nnews of the giant&#8217;s passing has stirred up a wave of emotions ranging from\nutter sadness to feelings of empowerment to do great things. Tributes were paid\nto Steve Jobs all over the internet. His life is described as one of a genius.\nTechnology celebrities have publicly commented on his&nbsp;death.</p>\n<p>Richard Stallman said the&nbsp;following:</p>\n<blockquote>\nI&#8217;m not glad he&#8217;s dead, but I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s gone.</blockquote>\n<p>While this could have been said better, I&#8217;m absolutely shocked by the harsh\ncomments the community has made towards Dr Stallman. I&#8217;m not trying to defend\nhim. He is a caricature like no other. The man possesses no social skills. But\nhe is a respected computer engineer that has changed the way software works\ntoday. He has a <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#Recognition\">number</a> of doctorates. Like Steve Jobs, Dr Stallman is a\nprogramming genius. His work on the <span class=\"caps\">GCC</span> compiler is&nbsp;substantial.</p>\n<p>Articles like the on <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/10/why-fsf-founder-richard-stallm.php\">ReadWriteWeb</a> are very disappointing. Let&#8217;s all be\ncivil and respectful of each&nbsp;other.</p>\n</div>\n",
