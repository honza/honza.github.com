The primary factor\nin looking good should be the choice of a good font at a comfortable size,\nand a syntax coloring theme that you like.  And that is not something\nspecific to an editor.  Editors like Emacs and vi have almost no <span class=\"caps\">UI</span>!  If\nEmacs is configured right, the only <span class=\"caps\">UI</span> it has is the modeline and the\nminibuffer.</blockquote>\n<p>Vivek Haldar in <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://blog.vivekhaldar.com/post/31970017734/new-frontiers-in-text-editing\">New Frontiers In Text&nbsp;Editing</a></p>\n</div>\n",
