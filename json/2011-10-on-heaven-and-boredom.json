They have in their minds this idea of us in\nheaven as chubby toddlers in diapers playing harps and flying around. To me\nthat would be&nbsp;hell.</p>\n<p>I would like to talk to you about why I think that heaven won&#8217;t be boring. Let\nme start by telling you a how my high school teacher explained to us the\nconcept of geometric parallels. She said they were two lines that didn&#8217;t\nintersect or touch. She also made a side note that the two parallels will\nintersect at one specific point, being&nbsp;infinity.</p>\n<p>It takes the two parallel lines all of infinity to reach each other. Now, keep\nthat in mind while we look at some&nbsp;Scripture.</p>\n<blockquote>\nBehold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and\nthey will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. &#8211;\nRevelation 21:3, <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span></blockquote>\n<p>The Bible says that God will live with us, among us, so we can know Him fully.\nGod is omnipotent, omniscient and infinite. To comprehend all of the depths of\nGod, all his wisdom, love and grace, we will need a long&nbsp;time.</p>\n<p>How long? Well, it&#8217;s easy. Exactly <em>one eternity</em>.</p>\n</div>\n",
