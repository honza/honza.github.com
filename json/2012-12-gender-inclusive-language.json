Rather,\nshe suggested, we should use the politically correct phrase <em>fishers of\npeople</em>.</p>\n<p>There is always talk of gender-inclusive language when it comes to Bible\ntranslation.  But this one seems a little too far.  Or it doesn&#8217;t feel&nbsp;right.</p>\n<p>As I have been thinking about this, I came across other things we say that that\nare sexist in this way that don&#8217;t seem to bother&nbsp;anyone.</p>\n<ol class=\"arabic simple\">\n<li>Watch any detective show and without fail, the perpetrator or killer will\nbe called <em>he</em> and <em>him</em>.  Women never&nbsp;kill.</li>\n<li>Within the committees of our church, we longer say <em>chairman</em> but\n<em>chairperson</em>.  If we were to follow that same logic, we should refer to\n<em>snowmen</em> as <em>snowpeople</em>.</li>\n<li>The other day, my family visited my mother-in-law while she was selling her\nhome <span class=\"amp\">&amp;</span> gift products at an event.  At one point, she said &#8220;&#8230; I can&#8217;t I&#8217;m\nmanning my table.&#8221;  Was she really?  Shouldn&#8217;t she have said <em>womanning</em>?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>A little&nbsp;absurd.</p>\n</div>\n",
