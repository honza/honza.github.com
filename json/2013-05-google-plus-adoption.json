Many\nblogs claim that adoption has been minimal and that the product isn&#8217;t appealing\nto common users over alternatives such as&nbsp;Facebook.</p>\n<p>I have noticed quite the opposite is true.  Many of my extended family in the\nCzech Republic have somewhat recently acquired new Android devices.  One by\none, they have added me to their circles on Google+.  My stream is now full of\npictures that my parents, aunts and uncles took with their phones.  Google\nuploads those pictures as soon as you take them and reminds you to share them.\nThis interface is so simple that even the average joe can share their content&nbsp;online.</p>\n<p>The way I see it, Google is doing something&nbsp;right.</p>\n</div>\n",
