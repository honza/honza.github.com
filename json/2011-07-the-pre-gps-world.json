I grew up in central Europe\nand over the years, we visited most of continental Europe. This was in the\nearly &#8216;90s. Usually, Mom would have a map on her lap and she would tell Dad\nwhere to go. To keep me and my little brother entertained, they gave us another\nmap and we would follow&nbsp;along.</p>\n<p>We had fun trying to pronounce funny city names and calculating distances that\nwe had travelled that day. Mostly, we had fun travelling in the car. Sometimes,\nwe would get lost though and tension in the car would rise. My brother and I\nwere always trying to help get us <em>unlost</em>. I remember thinking that it would\nbe so cool to have a tiny little car on the map to show you where you were so\nyou&#8217;d always know where you were&nbsp;going.</p>\n<p>Now, some fifteen years later, <span class=\"caps\">GPS</span> units are very common. A dream come&nbsp;true?</p>\n</div>\n",
