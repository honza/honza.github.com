Many Calvinistic and Reformed leaders endorse this\ntranslation, and use it in their books and articles.  I have personally used\nthis translation for many years, and have enjoyed it.  However, no translation\nis perfect.  This isn&#8217;t a superficial comment meant to appease those who prefer\nother translations.  Every translation of the Scriptures has deep flaws.  You\nare then left with a choice of a set of flaws that you prefer.  In this article,\nI&#8217;d like to point out why the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> is both the best translation I know of, and a\nterrible one at the same&nbsp;time.</p>\n<p>Many people have written accounts of their churches switching to the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span>.  In\nthis article, I&#8217;ll use Kevin DeYoung&#8217;s&nbsp;summary.</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"genitives\">\n<h2>Genitives</h2>\n<p>DeYoung&nbsp;says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n[T]he <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> leaves interpretive ambiguities unresolved so that the reader or\npreacher or student, rather than the translator, can determine which meaning\nis best. <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#id10\" id=\"id1\">[1]</a></blockquote>\n<p>This sounds wonderful.  We should certainly allow the Scriptures to speak as\nfreely as possible in English.  The example that DeYoung gives is that of the\nGreek&nbsp;genitive.</p>\n<blockquote>\nThe phrase &#8220;the love of Christ&#8221; translates the Greek <em>agape tou Christou</em>\nwhich is, grammatically, a nominative noun followed by a genitive noun. The\nlove of Christ could mean the love Christ has for us, or the love we have\nfor Christ, or both.  All three are possible from the Greek and from the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span>\ntranslation. The <span class=\"caps\">NIV</span>, however, translates 2 Corinthians 5:14 &#8220;For Christ&#8217;s\nlove compels us &#8230;&#8221;  This may be what the Greek phrase means (or it may not\nbe), but the <span class=\"caps\">NIV</span> has settled the matter for us&#8212;<em>agape tou Christou</em> means\nthe love Christ has for us (i.e., &#8220;Christ\u2019s love&#8221;)&#8212;and has not allowed the\nreader to come to his own conclusion. <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#id11\" id=\"id2\">[2]</a></blockquote>\n<p>This is a great example, and I fully agree with the decision that the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> makes.\nThe translation is being faithful to the original by using the same level of\nambiguity.  The problem, however, is that it only works in isolated examples\nlike this&nbsp;one.</p>\n<p>Mark Strauss, one of the translators of the New International Version, has\nwritten an article encouraging the wider Christian community to not allow the\n<span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> to become the standard English translation.  One of his criticisms of the\n<span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> is its treatment of Greek genitives.  The <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> follows the above ambiguity of\nthe Greek genitive too far in many&nbsp;cases.</p>\n<p>For example, the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> renders Hebrews 1:3 as &#8220;he upholds the universe by the word\nof his power&#8221;.  Strauss&nbsp;comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\nNonsensical (word that his power possesses?). This is an attributive\ngenitive, meaning &#8220;his powerful word&#8221; <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#id12\" id=\"id3\">[3]</a></blockquote>\n<p>Or Romans 6:4 is translated as &#8220;we too might walk in newness of life&#8221; in the\n<span class=\"caps\">ESV</span>.  Again Strauss says that this is an attributed genitive meaning &#8220;a new\nlife&#8221;. <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#id13\" id=\"id4\">[4]</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"archaisms\">\n<h2>Archaisms</h2>\n<p>DeYoung praises the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> for its commitment to literary&nbsp;beauty:</p>\n<blockquote>\n[T]he essentially literal approach of the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> in the book of Proverbs often\nsounds more, well, proverbial.  The <span class=\"caps\">NIV</span> often turns the aphoristic sound of\nproverbs into everyday conversation. Which sounds like a proverb and which\nsounds prosaic?  The difference between the two translations is the\ndifference between &#8220;A stitch in time saves nine&#8221; and &#8220;If you stitch\nsomething now, you\u2019ll save yourself nine stitches later.&#8221; Proverbs are\nsupposed to sound different from everyday speech. <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#id14\" id=\"id5\">[5]</a></blockquote>\n<p>He then compares the rendering of Proverbs 27:6 in the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> and the&nbsp;<span class=\"caps\">NIV</span>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">ESV</span>: &#8220;Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an&nbsp;enemy.&#8221;</p>\n<p><span class=\"caps\">NIV</span>: &#8220;Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies&nbsp;kisses.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agree with DeYoung&#8217;s assessment that the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> often translates the Proverbs\nand Psalms better than other translations.  The <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> seems to sound more\nreverent to my ears, and more like ancient literature. <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#id15\" id=\"id6\">[6]</a></p>\n<p>The problem with the commitment to literary beauty, however, is that it often\nleads to awkward language, and the proliferation of archaisms.  Let&#8217;s look at a\nfew examples from Mark Strauss&nbsp;again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Matthew&nbsp;1:18:</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"caps\">ESV</span></strong>: &#8230; she was found to be with&nbsp;child</p>\n<p><strong>Comment</strong>: The <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> is not literal here (the Greek idiom is &#8220;having in\nbelly&#8221;), so this can only be classified as an archaism. Of course I would\nnever say today my wife is &#8220;with child&#8221; unless I were trying to sound\narchaic and &#8220;biblical&#8221;. <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#id16\" id=\"id7\">[7]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I really can&#8217;t understand why the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> uses this kind of language.  What do we\ngain by refusing to say <em>pregnant</em>?&nbsp;More:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Matthew&nbsp;5:2</p>\n<p><strong><span class=\"caps\">ESV</span></strong>: And he opened his mouth and taught them,&nbsp;saying:</p>\n<p><strong>Comment</strong>: The <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> has missed the Greek idiom, which does not indicate two\nactions, but one&#8212;an introduction to a speech. No one speaking English would\nsay, &#8220;The teacher opened her mouth and taught the students, saying&#8230;&#8221; <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#id17\" id=\"id8\">[8]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"prepositions-and-conjunctions\">\n<h2>Prepositions and&nbsp;conjunctions</h2>\n<p>Another area where the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> shines is its treatment of conjunctions.  Careful\nexegesis must depend on how clauses within an argument relate to each other.\nThe <span class=\"caps\">NIV</span> often omits these small words to make the text flow better, or sound\nmore natural.  But my argument is that it often leads to loss of meaning that is\npresent in the original&nbsp;text.</p>\n<p>Here is an excellent example from Bill&nbsp;Mounce:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Take for example Heb 6:4. The author has been saying that he wants to leave\nthe basic, rudimentary doctrines of the Christian faith and move on to more\nmeaty, theological matters. And then, verses 4 to&nbsp;6.</p>\n<p><span class=\"dquo\">&#8220;</span>It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted\nthe heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the\ngoodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age and who have\nfallen away, to be brought back to repentance&#8221;&nbsp;(<span class=\"caps\">NIV</span>).</p>\n<p>Notice that there is no introductory conjunction in the <span class=\"caps\">NIV</span>, so what is the\nconnection of verse four to the preceding? The fact that verse four begins a\nnew paragraph suggests that we are moving on to a new topic. And yet the\ncareful Greek student sees that verse four begins with \u03b3\u03ac\u03c1. Is there a\nconnection that is obscured by the simple new&nbsp;paragraph?</p>\n<p>Absolutely. The flow of thought is clear. The reason that the author wants\nto move on to meatier matters is because of the people&#8217;s ignorance of the\ndoctrine of necessary perseverance. And so he says that they should move on,\nand the reason, introduced by \u03b3\u03ac\u03c1, is that if they do not persevere, they\nwill never return to&nbsp;repentance.</p>\n<p>This is why translations like the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span> translate the \u03b3\u03ac\u03c1: \u201c<em>For</em> it is\nimpossible.\u201d <a class=\"footnote-reference\" href=\"#id18\" id=\"id9\">[9]</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another example comes from a rather funny and serious <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xdc10WJVtZs\">video</a> by John Piper\nwhere he says you should get a Bible with all the words.  Piper bemoans the\nlikes of <span class=\"caps\">NIV</span> for leaving out words from their text that they seem to not know\nwhat to do with.  His text is John&nbsp;4:43&#8211;45:</p>\n<blockquote>\nAfter the two days he departed for Galilee. (<em>For</em> Jesus himself had\ntestified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.) <em>So</em> when he\ncame to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had\ndone in Jerusalem at the feast. For they too had gone to the feast. (<span class=\"caps\">ESV</span>)</blockquote>\n<p>I have highlighted the two conjunctions missing in the <span class=\"caps\">NIV</span>.  Here, the reason\nfor Jesus&#8217;s leaving is that there is no honor for a prophet in his home town.\nYou cannot make that same argument from the&nbsp;<span class=\"caps\">NIV</span>.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"conclusion\">\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Every translation must make hard decisions.  It is absolutely impossible to\nconvert text in one language to another without losing some meaning.  It&#8217;s true\nthat the <span class=\"caps\">NIV</span> often sounds more modern and normal.  But it can be imprecise, use\nover-translation and under-translation, and it can obscure the flow of an\nargument.  The <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span>, on the other hand, is much more precise, tries to give you\nall the words, but it can often sounds too archaic, awkward, and &#8220;biblical&#8221;.\nGiven these sets of flaws (as discussed in the introduction), I think I still\nprefer the&nbsp;<span class=\"caps\">ESV</span>.</p>\n<p>I hope this illustrates the need to consult many translations during serious\nstudy.  Hopefully, the diligent student of the Scriptures can indulge in at\nleast a rudimentary understanding of Greek and&nbsp;Hebrew.</p>\n<table class=\"docutils footnote\" frame=\"void\" id=\"id10\" rules=\"none\">\n<colgroup><col class=\"label\" /><col /></colgroup>\n<tbody valign=\"top\">\n<tr><td class=\"label\"><a class=\"fn-backref\" href=\"#id1\">[1]</a></td><td>Kevin DeYoung, <em>Why our church switched to the <span class=\"caps\">ESV</span></em> (Wheaton, <span class=\"caps\">IL</span>: Crossway, 2011), 11</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"docutils footnote\" frame=\"void\" id=\"id11\" rules=\"none\">\n<colgroup><col class=\"label\" /><col /></colgroup>\n<tbody valign=\"top\">\n<tr><td class=\"label\"><a class=\"fn-backref\" href=\"#id2\">[2]</a></td><td>Ibid., 11</td></tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table class=\"docutils footnote\" frame=\"void\" id=\"id12\" rules=\"none\">\n<colgroup><col class=\"label\" /><col /></colgroup>\n<tbody valign=\"top\">\n<tr><td class=\"label\"><a class=\"fn-backref\" href=\"#id3\">[3]</a></td><td>Mark L.
