The quote is from his\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://thomas.fuchs.usesthis.com/\">Setup</a>&nbsp;interview:</p>\n<blockquote>\nFor computer programmers, especially if you&#8217;re self-employed, there&#8217;s no\nexcuse whatsoever not to get the latest and greatest. You don&#8217;t really have\nother expenses anyway, it&#8217;s tax-deductible and, most importantly, it will\nmake you happy and more productive if you know that you&#8217;re using the best\navailable tools.</blockquote>\n<p>Do you&nbsp;agree?</p>\n</div>\n",
