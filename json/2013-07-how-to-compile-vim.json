You can of course get a pre-compiled\nversion and ignore this.  But I like to use the latest version of vim and with\nthe 7.4 beta, I have been doing that a lot&nbsp;lately&#8230;</p>\n<p>So, what is one to do?  We have to fix the <tt class=\"docutils literal\"><span class=\"caps\">PATH</span></tt>.  Here is the script that I\nuse to recompile vim.  This goes in the root of the vim&nbsp;project.</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span class=\"nb\">export </span><span class=\"nv\"><span class=\"caps\">PATH</span></span><span class=\"o\">=</span>/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/bin\n\n./configure <span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n        --enable-perlinterp <span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n        --enable-pythoninterp <span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n        --enable-rubyinterp <span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n        --enable-cscope <span class=\"se\">\\</span>\n        --with-features<span class=\"o\">=</span>huge\n\nmake\n</pre></div>\n<p>There and vim is now compiled properly with Python support that won&#8217;t make you&nbsp;cry.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Steve Losh for pointing me in the right direction on&nbsp;this.</p>\n</div>\n",
