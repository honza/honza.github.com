The code doesn&#8217;t make any sense, the programmers must have all\nbeen idiots, why <em>on earth</em> would they do it like this, &#8230;  I hate everything\nabout the&nbsp;code.</p>\n<p>I spend hours going through it, thinking to myself, <em>I would have done a much\nbetter job writing this</em> and making a list of changes that <em>must</em> be done in\norder for the project to conform to my&nbsp;standards.</p>\n<p>But then, when I have spent enough time reading everything, something clicks in\nmy mind.  I see what the authors were trying to do and everything makes sense.\nIt&#8217;s actually kind of&nbsp;clever.</p>\n<p>And I feel dumb.  Every&nbsp;time.</p>\n</div>\n",
