I learned to speak English and\nFrench in school.  When I was 19, I moved out of the country and have been\nliving in English-speaking countries ever since.  Gradually, I have been losing\nthe ability to speak my native language.  This is especially obvious in\nprofessional settings (work, bank, government offices, etc) since I learned to\nbe an adult while living in the <span class=\"caps\">UK</span>.  At this point, when speaking to strangers I\nfeel much more comfortable speaking English.  Even though my English is far from&nbsp;perfect.</p>\n<p>One thing that I have found over the years is that no matter how comfortable you\nget with another language, you will still count things in your head in your\nmother tongue.  Counting coins, or scoops, or sheep, or anything.  I am unable\nto count things quickly in English.  Somehow the brain isn&#8217;t able to work on\nkeeping the count in memory while incrementing the number once a second.\nSequential numbers must have been burned into my mind at an early age and thus\nenjoy special&nbsp;treatment.</p>\n<p>Are you bilingual?  Do you experience this,&nbsp;too?</p>\n</div>\n",
