This means that we believe that the Word of God contains no mistakes. I\nlove the way pastor Mark Driscoll puts&nbsp;it:</p>\n<blockquote>\nIf we see something in the Bible that we don&#8217;t agree with, it means we&#8217;re\nwrong.</blockquote>\n<p>I am continually amazed at how many people will dismiss entire passages in the\nBible as silly or primitive. We are intelligent modern people, we don&#8217;t believe\nin fairy tales. We have democracy now. We believe in&nbsp;equality.</p>\n<p>Let me remind you that the Bible is the book that God wrote. Is God different\ntoday and&nbsp;yesterday?</p>\n<p>Augustine:</p>\n<blockquote>\nIf you believe what you like in the gospel, and reject what you don&#8217;t like,\nit is not the gospel you believe, but yourself.</blockquote>\n<p>D. A.&nbsp;Carson:</p>\n<blockquote>\nThose who don&#8217;t have a high view of Scripture, do not feel bound to obey\nit.</blockquote>\n</div>\n",
