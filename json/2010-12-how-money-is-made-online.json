Here is\na quick example of how you can make money&nbsp;online.</p>\n<p>Warning: this is a not a get rich quick scheme. I&#8217;m not going teach you how to\nmake millions working for Google from&nbsp;home.</p>\n<p>I recently started following John Gruber&#8217;s blog <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://daringfireball.net/\">Darring Fireball</a>. This\ngentleman seems to be rather influential in the hacker community. On the\nwebsite, he says that there are more than 400,000 subscribers that frequently\nread his blog. In the world of Internet publishing, this is a great deal of\nexposure. Not very many people get this much&nbsp;attention.</p>\n<p>If you browse through the site, you will soon notice that you can sponsor John\nto write more articles. You can pay him $5,000/month - in return, a small\nbanner with your company&#8217;s advertising graphics will be displayed in a\nprominent place on John&#8217;s blog for that month. You will get millions of people\nevery month looking at your ad for just&nbsp;$5,000/month.</p>\n<p>Writing interesting articles about the web is a full-time job for&nbsp;John.</p>\n</div>\n",
