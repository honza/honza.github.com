Christ did\nnot give another law; Christ gave that law of the ten commandments.  To this\nlaw He subjected Himself and has perfectly lived according to it, leaving us an\nexample therein.  He Himself is also a living law. Christ has never given\nliberty to transgress any of the ten commandments, be it those that pertain to\nmurder, adultery, or theft, etc.  Thus, the law of Christ is the law of the ten&nbsp;commandments.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8212; Wilhelmus \u00e0 Brakel, <em>The Christian\u2018s Reasonable Service</em>, vol. 3 (Grand\nRapids, <span class=\"caps\">MI</span>: Reformation Heritage Books, 1992),&nbsp;58.</p>\n</div>\n",
