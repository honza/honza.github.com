Everyone has their own opinion, their own way\nof performing benchmarks and their own conclusions. And we all know that this\nis <em>very</em> silly. I recently came across an article by <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://twitter.com/dozba\">Ted Dziuba</a> that\nsummarizes it very nicely for&nbsp;you:</p>\n<blockquote>\nShut up about scalability, no one is using your app anyway.</blockquote>\n<p>I love how the author explains the use of the word <em>scalability</em> in this day\nand&nbsp;age:</p>\n<blockquote>\nThe most common butthurt about scalability is this: choose a technology. If\nyou like the technology, claim &#8220;technology X scales better!&#8221; If you don&#8217;t\nlike it, claim &#8220;technology X doesn&#8217;t scale!&#8221;</blockquote>\n<p>You can find the article <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://teddziuba.com/2008/04/im-going-to-scale-my-foot-up-y.html\">here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n",
