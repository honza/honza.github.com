I use Django and jQuery. And I cringe every\ntime I have to run <tt class=\"docutils literal\">gem install x</tt>. I only have a limited understanding of\nRuby and hardly any of Ruby on Rails. It seems disorganized to me and hard to\nprocess. All this is fine &#8211; I don&#8217;t have to use any of it if I don&#8217;t like it,&nbsp;right?</p>\n<p>I always knew there was something wrong with the way Ruby works. I don&#8217;t mean\nwrong like murdering children, I just mean wrong like I don&#8217;t know why things\nare the way they are. There are a lot of talented Ruby programmers and I don&#8217;t\nmean to dismiss&nbsp;that.</p>\n<p>Recently, though, I came across a tweet that I made me realize what it was that\nI didn&#8217;t like about Ruby. It was like a small&nbsp;revelation.</p>\n<blockquote>\nMarkup is markup, not Ruby. JavaScript is JavaScript, not Ruby. <span class=\"caps\">CSS</span> is <span class=\"caps\">CSS</span>,\nnot Ruby. Get that in your head before I slap you. - <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://twitter.com/#!/ara_p/status/81425173965832193\">&#64;ara_p</a></blockquote>\n<p>Do you get it? <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/erb/rdoc/classes/ERB.html\"><span class=\"caps\">ERB</span></a> is Ruby with some html-like fragments mixed in.\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/\">CoffeeScript</a> is a Ruby-like language that compiles to Javascript. <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a> is\na Ruby-like language for writing css&nbsp;files.</p>\n<p>Before you know it, everything will be in&nbsp;Ruby.</p>\n</div>\n",
