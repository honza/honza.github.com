Here is a list of common&nbsp;things:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>Chapter&nbsp;numbers</li>\n<li>Verse&nbsp;numbers</li>\n<li>Chapter&nbsp;headings</li>\n<li>Translation&nbsp;footnotes</li>\n<li>Cross-references (in the text, and in the center&nbsp;column)</li>\n<li>Chain&nbsp;references</li>\n<li>Pilcrows</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The traditional setting also includes things&nbsp;like:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>Double&nbsp;column</li>\n<li>Verse-by-verse setting (where each verse starts on a new&nbsp;line)</li>\n<li>Words in&nbsp;italics</li>\n<li>Pronunciation&nbsp;marks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While these tools might be helpful for study, they certain don&#8217;t help with\nfluency in reading.  They get in the way of your flow.  As a result, you might\nbecome tired more&nbsp;quickly.</p>\n<p>Instead, if bibles are to be read for extended periods of time, we should design\nthem in such a way to support that goal.  This usually&nbsp;means:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>Single&nbsp;column</li>\n<li>Larger&nbsp;font</li>\n<li>No&nbsp;references</li>\n<li>Paragraph&nbsp;format</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is what the vast majority of novels produced today looks like.  Novels are\nworks of fiction meant for enjoyment.  You should be able to read them\ncomfortably and&nbsp;easily.</p>\n<p>Why shouldn&#8217;t we be free to read our bibles this&nbsp;way?</p>\n<p>Above, you see the first few sentences of the first chapter of Jane Austen&#8217;s\n<em>Pride and Prejudice</em>.  I broke it up into verses, started each verse on a new\nline, added some references and footnotes, and pilcrows.  You will also notice\nthe center column for references.  The proportions of the page have been\ninspired by <span class=\"caps\">R.L.</span> Allan&#8217;s <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC0VIrRCpPA\">Longprimer 62</a>.</p>\n<p>There is a <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"/img/austen.pdf\"><span class=\"caps\">PDF</span></a> of the whole page for&nbsp;download.</p>\n</div>\n",
