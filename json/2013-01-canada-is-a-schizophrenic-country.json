Canadians will&nbsp;say:</p>\n<ul class=\"simple\">\n<li>colour, favourite, honour (which are all&nbsp;British)</li>\n<li>program, realize (which are all&nbsp;American)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"measuring-units\">\n<h2>Measuring&nbsp;units</h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re driving in Canada, everything is in kilometers.  Snow fall is\nmeasured in centimeters.  And yet, people insist on weighing and measuring\nthemselves in pounds.  We just had a baby girl here in Canada and they kept\nsaying, <em>Look she is so big, she is probably over eight.</em>.  Sure, she was nice\nand big but she certainly didn&#8217;t weight 8kg!  People ask me, <em>How tall are\nyou?</em>, and I respond with 178 and receive blank&nbsp;stares.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
