Especially by authors who have long\npassed on to glory.  And who wouldn&#8217;t want to save some&nbsp;money?</p>\n<p>Here is what you&nbsp;do:</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"step-1-buy-an-amazon-kindle\">\n<h2>Step 1: Buy an Amazon&nbsp;Kindle</h2>\n<p>The base model is $79.  You can find it on sale during the usual sale events.\nOr, for a more comfortable reading experience, you can go for the Paperwhite,\nwhich is about twice as much.  Both are excellent options.  The advantage of the\nPaperwhite is the backlight, and the higher screen&nbsp;resolution.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"step-2-acquire-books\">\n<h2>Step 2: Acquire&nbsp;books</h2>\n<p>Head over to Monergism&#8217;s <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.monergism.com/400-free-ebooks-listed-alphabetically-author\">huge list</a> of free theology ebooks.  Scroll through\nthe list, find something you like, download it to your&nbsp;Kindle.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"step-3-profit\">\n<h2>Step 3:&nbsp;Profit</h2>\n<p>If there are 400 books, and if you downloaded each one, and if the printed paper\ncopy cost at least $1 (which it probably costs a <em>lot</em> more), you are saving at\nleast&nbsp;$300.</p>\n<p>If we assume that each book on the list has an average price of $30, you are\nsaving about&nbsp;$12,000.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",
