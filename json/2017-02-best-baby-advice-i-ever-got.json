Fatherhood is one of\nthose &#8220;learn on the job&#8221; situations.  With a new infant in the house, one piece\nof advice made my life much&nbsp;easier.</p>\n<p>Infants cry a lot.  The noise they emit is high-pitch, and designed to be\nirritating to adults.  It&#8217;s irritating because otherwise you would just ignore\nthe poor&nbsp;child.</p>\n<p>Now, to the advice: when your infant starts to scream in the middle of the\nnight, look at the clock.  Yes, look at the clock.  Before you roll out of bed,\nbefore you stumble your way to the nursery, check the clock, and remember what\ntime it is.  This is the best advice I ever&nbsp;got.</p>\n<p>When you are sleep-deprived and tired, holding a screaming infant in the middle\nof the night for one minute can seem like 10.  Noting the time can put things\ninto perspective.  You&#8217;ll calm down and have more patience when you realize that\nthe <em>eternity</em> of constant scream is only 10&nbsp;minutes.</p>\n<p>Look at the&nbsp;clock.</p>\n</div>\n",
