<h1>Best baby advice I ever&nbsp;got</h1>
<p>When I became a father, I didn&#8217;t know much about babies.  Fatherhood is one of
those &#8220;learn on the job&#8221; situations.  With a new infant in the house, one piece
of advice made my life much&nbsp;easier.</p>
<p>Infants cry a lot.  The noise they emit is high-pitch, and designed to be
irritating to adults.  It&#8217;s irritating because otherwise you would just ignore
the poor&nbsp;child.</p>
<p>Now, to the advice: when your infant starts to scream in the middle of the
night, look at the clock.  Yes, look at the clock.  Before you roll out of bed,
before you stumble your way to the nursery, check the clock, and remember what
time it is.  This is the best advice I ever&nbsp;got.</p>
<p>When you are sleep-deprived and tired, holding a screaming infant in the middle
of the night for one minute can seem like 10.  Noting the time can put things
into perspective.  You&#8217;ll calm down and have more patience when you realize that
the <em>eternity</em> of constant scream is only 10&nbsp;minutes.</p>
<p>Look at the&nbsp;clock.</p>
