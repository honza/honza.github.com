<h1>Comparing editions of the&nbsp;Institutes</h1>
<p>The way I see it, you have three options when selection an edition of John
Calvin&#8217;s Institutes of the Christian&nbsp;Religion.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The final edition of 1560 translated by Henry Beveridge, published in&nbsp;1867.</li>
<li>The final edition of 1560 translated by Ford Lewis Battles, published in&nbsp;1960.</li>
<li>The French edition of 1541 translated by Robert White, published in&nbsp;2014.</li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="beveridge">
<h2>Beveridge</h2>
<p>With <em>Beveridge</em>, you get the full text of the <em>Institutes</em>.  The language is
somewhat archaic and a bit convoluted sometimes.  It&#8217;s a lot easier to read than
the Puritans.  This translation is in the public domain, so you can read it for
free online, and printed editions are relatively&nbsp;cheap.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 1, Section&nbsp;2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, it is evident that man never attains to a true
self-knowledge until he have previously contemplated the face of God, and
come down after such contemplation to look into himself. For (such is our
innate pride) we always seem to ourselves just, and upright, and wise, and
holy, until we are convinced, by clear evidence, of our injustice, vileness,
folly, and impurity. Convinced, however, we are not, if we look to ourselves
only, and not to the Lord also—he being the only standard by the application
of which this conviction can be produced. For, since we are all naturally
prone to hypocrisy, any empty semblance of righteousness is quite enough to
satisfy us instead of righteousness itself. And since nothing appears within
us or around us that is not tainted with very great impurity, so long as we
keep our mind within the confines of human pollution, anything which is in
some small degree less defiled delights us as if it were most pure: just as
an eye, to which nothing but black had been previously presented, deems an
object of a whitish, or even of a brownish hue, to be perfectly white. No,
the bodily sense may furnish a still stronger illustration of the extent to
which we are deluded in estimating the powers of the&nbsp;mind.</p>
<p>If, at mid-day, we either look down to the ground, or on the surrounding
objects which lie open to our view, we think ourselves endued with a very
strong and piercing eyesight; but when we look up to the sun, and gaze at it
unveiled, the sight which did excellently well for the earth is instantly so
dazzled and confounded by the refulgence, as to oblige us to confess that
our acuteness in discerning terrestrial objects is mere dimness when applied
to the sun. Thus, too, it happens in estimating our spiritual qualities. So
long as we do not look beyond the earth, we are quite pleased with our own
righteousness, wisdom, and virtue; we address ourselves in the most
flattering terms, and seem only less than&nbsp;demigods.</p>

<div class="section" id="battles">
<h2>Battles</h2>
<p>With <em>Battles</em>, you get the full text in its final form.  This is the academic
reference edition.  If you are going to write a paper or a book, and you want to
quote Calvin, use this.  The language is much more modern than <em>Beveridge</em> but
still a bit technical at times.  The biggest downside of this edition is that it
comes in two volumes and it&#8217;s very&nbsp;expensive.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 1, Section&nbsp;2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, it is certain that man never achieves a clear knowledge of himself
unless he has first looked upon God&#8217;s face, and then descends from
contemplating him to scrutinize himself.  For we always seem to ourselves
righteous and upright and wise and holy&#8212;this pride is innate in all of
us&#8212;unless by clear proofs we stand convinced of our own unrighteousness,
foulness, folly, and impurity.  Moreover, we are not thus convinced if we
look merely to ourselves and not also to the Lord, who is the sole standard
by which this judgment must be measured.  For, because all of us are
inclined by nature to hypocrisy, a kind of empty image of righteousness in
place of righteousness itself abundantly satisfies us.  And because nothing
appears within or around us that has not been contaminated by great
immorality, what is a little less vile pleases us as a thing most pure&#8212;so
long as we confine our minds within the limits of human corruption.  Just
so, an eye to which nothing is shown but black objects judges something
dirty white or even rather darkly mottle to be whiteness itself.  Indeed, we
can discern still more clearly from the bodily senses how much we are
deluded in estimating the powers of the&nbsp;soul.</p>
<p>For if in broad daylight we either look down upon the ground or survey
whatever meets our view round about, we seem to ourselves endowed with the
strongest and keenest sight; yet when we look up to the sun and gaze
straight at it, that power of sight which was particularly strong on earth
is at once blunted and confused by a great brilliance, and thus we are
compelled to admin that our keenness in looking upon things earthly is sheer
dullness when it comes to the sun.  So it happens in estimating our
spiritual goods.  As long as we do not look beyond the earth, being quite
content with our own righteousness, wisdom and virtue, we flatter ourselves
most sweetly, and fancy ourselves all bug&nbsp;demigods.</p>

<div class="section" id="white">
<h2>White</h2>
<p>With <em>White</em>, you get an earlier version of the <em>Institutes</em>.  It&#8217;s missing some
sections from the final, but not much (e.g. it&#8217;s missing Calvin&#8217;s defense of
paedobaptism).  This is translated from the French edition which is known for
its lively prose.  The biggest draw for this edition is its recency, only 2014.
The language is very modern and flows nicely.  The printed edition costs a bit
more than <em>Beverage</em> but still a lot less than <em>Battles</em>.  This edition will
serve hobbyists well.  The newness of the language will provide you with higher
likelihood of&nbsp;finishing.</p>
<p>Book 1, Chapter 1, Section&nbsp;2</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conversely, we observe that no one ever attains clear knowledge of self unless
he has first gazed upon the face of the Lord, and then turns back to look upon
himself. Deeply rooted in all of us is an arrogance which persuades us that we
are righteous, truthful, wise and holy. Only clear evidence that we are
unrighteous, deceitful, foolish and vile will convince us of the contrary. We
feel no such conviction if all we do is look upon ourselves and not also upon
the Lord. He is the one and only standard with which our judgment must
accord. But because hypocrisy is something to which we are all naturally prone,
we are quite content with an empty show of righteousness rather than with its
reality. And because there is nothing around us which is not greatly defiled,
whatever is a little less grubby appears to us as purity itself, as long as we
confine our attention to the limits of our own—debased—humanity. It is like the
eye which, used to seeing only objects that are dark, judges things which are
vaguely white or even semi-grey to be the whitest there is.  An analogy based on
physical sight will help us better understand how badly we misjudge our soul’s&nbsp;powers.</p>
<p>If in broad daylight we look down at the ground or attend to things which are
round about us, we have no trouble believing our sight is extremely sharp and
keen. When, however, we look straight up at the sun, the power that served us so
well on earth is dazed and dazzled by so intense a light, forcing us to admit
that our ability clearly to see earthly objects is weak and feeble when it comes
to gazing at the sun. This is how it is when we try to estimate our spiritual
strengths. As long as we do not look beyond earth’s horizons, we are perfectly
content with our own righteousness, wisdom and power.  We flatter and
congratulate ourselves, and are not far from thinking we are&nbsp;demigods!</p>
