<h1>Why the <span class="caps">ESV</span> is both excellent and&nbsp;terrible</h1>
<p>In conservative Christian circles, the English Standard Version seems to be the
Bible translation of choice.  Many Calvinistic and Reformed leaders endorse this
translation, and use it in their books and articles.  I have personally used
this translation for many years, and have enjoyed it.  However, no translation
is perfect.  This isn&#8217;t a superficial comment meant to appease those who prefer
other translations.  Every translation of the Scriptures has deep flaws.  You
are then left with a choice of a set of flaws that you prefer.  In this article,
I&#8217;d like to point out why the <span class="caps">ESV</span> is both the best translation I know of, and a
terrible one at the same&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Many people have written accounts of their churches switching to the <span class="caps">ESV</span>.  In
this article, I&#8217;ll use Kevin DeYoung&#8217;s&nbsp;summary.</p>
<div class="section" id="genitives">
<h2>Genitives</h2>
<p>DeYoung&nbsp;says:</p>
<blockquote>
[T]he <span class="caps">ESV</span> leaves interpretive ambiguities unresolved so that the reader or
preacher or student, rather than the translator, can determine which meaning
is best. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id10" id="id1">[1]</a></blockquote>
<p>This sounds wonderful.  We should certainly allow the Scriptures to speak as
freely as possible in English.  The example that DeYoung gives is that of the
Greek&nbsp;genitive.</p>
<blockquote>
The phrase &#8220;the love of Christ&#8221; translates the Greek <em>agape tou Christou</em>
which is, grammatically, a nominative noun followed by a genitive noun. The
love of Christ could mean the love Christ has for us, or the love we have
for Christ, or both.  All three are possible from the Greek and from the <span class="caps">ESV</span>
translation. The <span class="caps">NIV</span>, however, translates 2 Corinthians 5:14 &#8220;For Christ&#8217;s
love compels us &#8230;&#8221;  This may be what the Greek phrase means (or it may not
be), but the <span class="caps">NIV</span> has settled the matter for us&#8212;<em>agape tou Christou</em> means
the love Christ has for us (i.e., &#8220;Christ’s love&#8221;)&#8212;and has not allowed the
reader to come to his own conclusion. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id11" id="id2">[2]</a></blockquote>
<p>This is a great example, and I fully agree with the decision that the <span class="caps">ESV</span> makes.
The translation is being faithful to the original by using the same level of
ambiguity.  The problem, however, is that it only works in isolated examples
like this&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>Mark Strauss, one of the translators of the New International Version, has
written an article encouraging the wider Christian community to not allow the
<span class="caps">ESV</span> to become the standard English translation.  One of his criticisms of the
<span class="caps">ESV</span> is its treatment of Greek genitives.  The <span class="caps">ESV</span> follows the above ambiguity of
the Greek genitive too far in many&nbsp;cases.</p>
<p>For example, the <span class="caps">ESV</span> renders Hebrews 1:3 as &#8220;he upholds the universe by the word
of his power&#8221;.  Strauss&nbsp;comments:</p>
<blockquote>
Nonsensical (word that his power possesses?). This is an attributive
genitive, meaning &#8220;his powerful word&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id3">[3]</a></blockquote>
<p>Or Romans 6:4 is translated as &#8220;we too might walk in newness of life&#8221; in the
<span class="caps">ESV</span>.  Again Strauss says that this is an attributed genitive meaning &#8220;a new
life&#8221;. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id13" id="id4">[4]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="archaisms">
<h2>Archaisms</h2>
<p>DeYoung praises the <span class="caps">ESV</span> for its commitment to literary&nbsp;beauty:</p>
<blockquote>
[T]he essentially literal approach of the <span class="caps">ESV</span> in the book of Proverbs often
sounds more, well, proverbial.  The <span class="caps">NIV</span> often turns the aphoristic sound of
proverbs into everyday conversation. Which sounds like a proverb and which
sounds prosaic?  The difference between the two translations is the
difference between &#8220;A stitch in time saves nine&#8221; and &#8220;If you stitch
something now, you’ll save yourself nine stitches later.&#8221; Proverbs are
supposed to sound different from everyday speech. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id14" id="id5">[5]</a></blockquote>
<p>He then compares the rendering of Proverbs 27:6 in the <span class="caps">ESV</span> and the&nbsp;<span class="caps">NIV</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">ESV</span>: &#8220;Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an&nbsp;enemy.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="caps">NIV</span>: &#8220;Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies&nbsp;kisses.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with DeYoung&#8217;s assessment that the <span class="caps">ESV</span> often translates the Proverbs
and Psalms better than other translations.  The <span class="caps">ESV</span> seems to sound more
reverent to my ears, and more like ancient literature. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id15" id="id6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The problem with the commitment to literary beauty, however, is that it often
leads to awkward language, and the proliferation of archaisms.  Let&#8217;s look at a
few examples from Mark Strauss&nbsp;again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew&nbsp;1:18:</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ESV</span></strong>: &#8230; she was found to be with&nbsp;child</p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong>: The <span class="caps">ESV</span> is not literal here (the Greek idiom is &#8220;having in
belly&#8221;), so this can only be classified as an archaism. Of course I would
never say today my wife is &#8220;with child&#8221; unless I were trying to sound
archaic and &#8220;biblical&#8221;. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id16" id="id7">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really can&#8217;t understand why the <span class="caps">ESV</span> uses this kind of language.  What do we
gain by refusing to say <em>pregnant</em>?&nbsp;More:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew&nbsp;5:2</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ESV</span></strong>: And he opened his mouth and taught them,&nbsp;saying:</p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong>: The <span class="caps">ESV</span> has missed the Greek idiom, which does not indicate two
actions, but one&#8212;an introduction to a speech. No one speaking English would
say, &#8220;The teacher opened her mouth and taught the students, saying&#8230;&#8221; <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="prepositions-and-conjunctions">
<h2>Prepositions and&nbsp;conjunctions</h2>
<p>Another area where the <span class="caps">ESV</span> shines is its treatment of conjunctions.  Careful
exegesis must depend on how clauses within an argument relate to each other.
The <span class="caps">NIV</span> often omits these small words to make the text flow better, or sound
more natural.  But my argument is that it often leads to loss of meaning that is
present in the original&nbsp;text.</p>
<p>Here is an excellent example from Bill&nbsp;Mounce:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take for example Heb 6:4. The author has been saying that he wants to leave
the basic, rudimentary doctrines of the Christian faith and move on to more
meaty, theological matters. And then, verses 4 to&nbsp;6.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted
the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the
goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age and who have
fallen away, to be brought back to repentance&#8221;&nbsp;(<span class="caps">NIV</span>).</p>
<p>Notice that there is no introductory conjunction in the <span class="caps">NIV</span>, so what is the
connection of verse four to the preceding? The fact that verse four begins a
new paragraph suggests that we are moving on to a new topic. And yet the
careful Greek student sees that verse four begins with γάρ. Is there a
connection that is obscured by the simple new&nbsp;paragraph?</p>
<p>Absolutely. The flow of thought is clear. The reason that the author wants
to move on to meatier matters is because of the people&#8217;s ignorance of the
doctrine of necessary perseverance. And so he says that they should move on,
and the reason, introduced by γάρ, is that if they do not persevere, they
will never return to&nbsp;repentance.</p>
<p>This is why translations like the <span class="caps">ESV</span> translate the γάρ: “<em>For</em> it is
impossible.” <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id18" id="id9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another example comes from a rather funny and serious <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xdc10WJVtZs">video</a> by John Piper
where he says you should get a Bible with all the words.  Piper bemoans the
likes of <span class="caps">NIV</span> for leaving out words from their text that they seem to not know
what to do with.  His text is John&nbsp;4:43&#8211;45:</p>
<blockquote>
After the two days he departed for Galilee. (<em>For</em> Jesus himself had
testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.) <em>So</em> when he
came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had
done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they too had gone to the feast. (<span class="caps">ESV</span>)</blockquote>
<p>I have highlighted the two conjunctions missing in the <span class="caps">NIV</span>.  Here, the reason
for Jesus&#8217;s leaving is that there is no honor for a prophet in his home town.
You cannot make that same argument from the&nbsp;<span class="caps">NIV</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Every translation must make hard decisions.  It is absolutely impossible to
convert text in one language to another without losing some meaning.  It&#8217;s true
that the <span class="caps">NIV</span> often sounds more modern and normal.  But it can be imprecise, use
over-translation and under-translation, and it can obscure the flow of an
argument.  The <span class="caps">ESV</span>, on the other hand, is much more precise, tries to give you
all the words, but it can often sounds too archaic, awkward, and &#8220;biblical&#8221;.
Given these sets of flaws (as discussed in the introduction), I think I still
prefer the&nbsp;<span class="caps">ESV</span>.</p>
<p>I hope this illustrates the need to consult many translations during serious
study.  Hopefully, the diligent student of the Scriptures can indulge in at
least a rudimentary understanding of Greek and&nbsp;Hebrew.</p>
