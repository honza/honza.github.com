<article>
  <p>In conservative Christian circles, the English Standard Version seems to be the
Bible translation of choice. Many Calvinistic and Reformed leaders endorse this
translation, and use it in their books and articles. I have personally used
this translation for many years, and have enjoyed it. However, no translation
is perfect. This isn&rsquo;t a superficial comment meant to appease those who prefer
other translations. Every translation of the Scriptures has deep flaws. You
are then left with a choice of a set of flaws that you prefer. In this article,
I&rsquo;d like to point out why the ESV is both the best translation I know of, and a
terrible one at the same time.</p>
<p>Many people have written accounts of their churches switching to the ESV. In
this article, I&rsquo;ll use Kevin DeYoung&rsquo;s summary.</p>
<h2 id="genitives">Genitives</h2>
<p>DeYoung says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he ESV leaves interpretive ambiguities unresolved so that the reader or
preacher or student, rather than the translator, can determine which meaning
is best. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds wonderful. We should certainly allow the Scriptures to speak as
freely as possible in English. The example that DeYoung gives is that of the
Greek genitive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The phrase &ldquo;the love of Christ&rdquo; translates the Greek <em>agape tou Christou</em>
which is, grammatically, a nominative noun followed by a genitive noun. The
love of Christ could mean the love Christ has for us, or the love we have
for Christ, or both. All three are possible from the Greek and from the ESV
translation. The NIV, however, translates 2 Corinthians 5:14 &ldquo;For Christ&rsquo;s
love compels us &hellip;&rdquo; This may be what the Greek phrase means (or it may not
be), but the NIV has settled the matter for us&mdash;<em>agape tou Christou</em> means
the love Christ has for us (i.e., &ldquo;Christ’s love&rdquo;)&mdash;and has not allowed the
reader to come to his own conclusion. <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a great example, and I fully agree with the decision that the ESV makes.
The translation is being faithful to the original by using the same level of
ambiguity. The problem, however, is that it only works in isolated examples
like this one.</p>
<p>Mark Strauss, one of the translators of the New International Version, has
written an article encouraging the wider Christian community to not allow the
ESV to become the standard English translation. One of his criticisms of the
ESV is its treatment of Greek genitives. The ESV follows the above ambiguity of
the Greek genitive too far in many cases.</p>
<p>For example, the ESV renders Hebrews 1:3 as &ldquo;he upholds the universe by the word
of his power&rdquo;. Strauss comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nonsensical (word that his power possesses?). This is an attributive
genitive, meaning &ldquo;his powerful word&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or Romans 6:4 is translated as &ldquo;we too might walk in newness of life&rdquo; in the
ESV. Again Strauss says that this is an attributed genitive meaning &ldquo;a new
life&rdquo;. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="archaisms">Archaisms</h2>
<p>DeYoung praises the ESV for its commitment to literary beauty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]he essentially literal approach of the ESV in the book of Proverbs often
sounds more, well, proverbial. The NIV often turns the aphoristic sound of
proverbs into everyday conversation. Which sounds like a proverb and which
sounds prosaic? The difference between the two translations is the
difference between &ldquo;A stitch in time saves nine&rdquo; and &ldquo;If you stitch
something now, you’ll save yourself nine stitches later.&rdquo; Proverbs are
supposed to sound different from everyday speech. <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then compares the rendering of Proverbs 27:6 in the ESV and the NIV:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ESV: &ldquo;Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NIV: &ldquo;Wounds from a friend can be trusted, but an enemy multiplies kisses.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with DeYoung&rsquo;s assessment that the ESV often translates the Proverbs
and Psalms better than other translations. The ESV seems to sound more
reverent to my ears, and more like ancient literature. <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>
<p>The problem with the commitment to literary beauty, however, is that it often
leads to awkward language, and the proliferation of archaisms. Let&rsquo;s look at a
few examples from Mark Strauss again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 1:18:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ESV<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: &hellip; she was found to be with child</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Comment<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: The ESV is not literal here (the Greek idiom is &ldquo;having in
belly&rdquo;), so this can only be classified as an archaism. Of course I would
never say today my wife is &ldquo;with child&rdquo; unless I were trying to sound
archaic and &ldquo;biblical&rdquo;. <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really can&rsquo;t understand why the ESV uses this kind of language. What do we
gain by refusing to say <em>pregnant</em>? More:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Matthew 5:2</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->ESV<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Comment<!-- raw HTML omitted -->: The ESV has missed the Greek idiom, which does not indicate two
actions, but one&mdash;an introduction to a speech. No one speaking English would
say, &ldquo;The teacher opened her mouth and taught the students, saying&hellip;&quot; <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="prepositions-and-conjunctions">Prepositions and conjunctions</h2>
<p>Another area where the ESV shines is its treatment of conjunctions. Careful
exegesis must depend on how clauses within an argument relate to each other.
The NIV often omits these small words to make the text flow better, or sound
more natural. But my argument is that it often leads to loss of meaning that is
present in the original text.</p>
<p>Here is an excellent example from Bill Mounce:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take for example Heb 6:4. The author has been saying that he wants to leave
the basic, rudimentary doctrines of the Christian faith and move on to more
meaty, theological matters. And then, verses 4 to 6.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible for those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted
the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit, who have tasted the
goodness of the word of God and the powers of the coming age and who have
fallen away, to be brought back to repentance&rdquo; (NIV).</p>
<p>Notice that there is no introductory conjunction in the NIV, so what is the
connection of verse four to the preceding? The fact that verse four begins a
new paragraph suggests that we are moving on to a new topic. And yet the
careful Greek student sees that verse four begins with γάρ. Is there a
connection that is obscured by the simple new paragraph?</p>
<p>Absolutely. The flow of thought is clear. The reason that the author wants
to move on to meatier matters is because of the people&rsquo;s ignorance of the
doctrine of necessary perseverance. And so he says that they should move on,
and the reason, introduced by γάρ, is that if they do not persevere, they
will never return to repentance.</p>
<p>This is why translations like the ESV translate the γάρ: “/For/ it is
impossible.” <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another example comes from a rather funny and serious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xdc10WJVtZs">video</a> by John Piper
where he says you should get a Bible with all the words. Piper bemoans the
likes of NIV for leaving out words from their text that they seem to not know
what to do with. His text is John 4:43&ndash;45:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the two days he departed for Galilee. (<em>For</em> Jesus himself had
testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.) <em>So</em> when he
came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had
done in Jerusalem at the feast. For they too had gone to the feast. (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have highlighted the two conjunctions missing in the NIV. Here, the reason
for Jesus&rsquo;s leaving is that there is no honor for a prophet in his home town.
You cannot make that same argument from the NIV.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Every translation must make hard decisions. It is absolutely impossible to
convert text in one language to another without losing some meaning. It&rsquo;s true
that the NIV often sounds more modern and normal. But it can be imprecise, use
over-translation and under-translation, and it can obscure the flow of an
argument. The ESV, on the other hand, is much more precise, tries to give you
all the words, but it can often sounds too archaic, awkward, and &ldquo;biblical&rdquo;.
Given these sets of flaws (as discussed in the introduction), I think I still
prefer the ESV.</p>
<p>I hope this illustrates the need to consult many translations during serious
study. Hopefully, the diligent student of the Scriptures can indulge in at
least a rudimentary understanding of Greek and Hebrew.</p>
