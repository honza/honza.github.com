<h1>Water&nbsp;consumption</h1>
<p>During the 2016 edition of the Super Bowl, Colgate ran an ad highlighting our
overconsumption of water during tooth-brushing.  The ad is emotinally charged
with images of people from poverty-ridden countries.  You can watch it&nbsp;below.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IS4lGnGfHTw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><p>Colgate claim that you waste up to 4 gallons (15L) of water if you leave the
fauset running.  They intend to guilt you into conserving&nbsp;water.</p>
<p>On a global scale, turning the fauset off when you brush your teeth will have a
minimal effect.  And not because you are only a single person making a change.
Domestic consumption accounts for only about 5% of water use.  If we all made a
change leading to a reduction of water consumption by 50%, the overall domestic
use would drop to 2.5%.  And 50% is pretty&nbsp;dramatic.</p>
<p>So, who is using all the water in the world?  According to the ground-breaking
research by the people behind the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cowspiracy.com/">Cowspiracy</a> documentary, 55% of water
consumption in the United States goes towards animal agriculture.  An immense
amount of water is required to produce meat and dairy&nbsp;products.</p>
<img alt="/img/cowspiracy.png" src="/img/cowspiracy.png" />
<p>So instead of worrying about the running tap, we should stop eating meat and
dairy.  Doing so will have a much more significant impact on the world.  But of
course, that isn&#8217;t as feel-good as the tooth-brushing&nbsp;story.</p>
