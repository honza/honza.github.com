  <h1>Water consumption</h1>

<article>
  <p>During the 2016 edition of the Super Bowl, Colgate ran an ad highlighting our
overconsumption of water during tooth-brushing. The ad is emotinally charged
with images of people from poverty-ridden countries. You can watch it below.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On a global scale, turning the fauset off when you brush your teeth will have a
minimal effect. And not because you are only a single person making a change.
Domestic consumption accounts for only about 5% of water use. If we all made a
change leading to a reduction of water consumption by 50%, the overall domestic
use would drop to 2.5%. And 50% is pretty dramatic.</p>
<p>So, who is using all the water in the world? According to the ground-breaking
research by the people behind the <a href="http://www.cowspiracy.com/">Cowspiracy</a> documentary, 55% of water
consumption in the United States goes towards animal agriculture. An immense
amount of water is required to produce meat and dairy products.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cowspiracy.png" alt="">So instead of worrying about the running tap, we should stop eating meat and
dairy. Doing so will have a much more significant impact on the world. But of
course, that isn&rsquo;t as feel-good as the tooth-brushing story.</p>
