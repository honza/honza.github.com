<h1>The Marathon&nbsp;obsession</h1>
<p>This morning, I read a rather click-baity <a class="reference external" href="http://runningmagazine.ca/11-questions-runners-hate-answering/">article</a> about the kinds of
questions that runners hate answering.  Honestly, I don&#8217;t know why I clicked it
&#8212; blame it on lack of coffee in my blood stream.  A common theme in the
article is the obsession with the marathon.  When are you running your first
marathon?  Are you training for Boston?  The writer then goes on to say that
she is perfectly happy with her 5ks and&nbsp;10ks.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m also tired of the marathon obsession,  but from the other end of the
spectrum.  The marathon distance isn&#8217;t the pinnacle of a runner&#8217;s career.  You
can run further.  Your legs don&#8217;t magically stop working after&nbsp;42.2km.</p>
<p>The following quote from Christopher McDougall&#8217;s <em>Born to run</em> gives us a nice
glimpse into the mindset of an ultra runner.  This tiny section is one of my
favorite parts in the&nbsp;book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>So why not marathons?&#8221; I asked Jenn when I called to interview her about
the Young Guns. &#8220;Do you think you could qualify for the Olympic&nbsp;Trials?&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Dude, seriously,&#8221; she&#8217;d said. &#8220;The qualifying standard is 2:48. Anyone can
make it.&#8221; Jenn could run a sub-three-hour marathon while wearing a string
bikini and chugging a beer at mile 23-and she would, just five days after
running a 50-mile trail race in the Blue Ridge&nbsp;Mountains.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>But then what?&#8221; Jenn went on. &#8220;I hate all this hype about the marathon.
Where&#8217;s the mystery? I know a girl who&#8217;s training for the Trials, and she&#8217;s
got every single workout planned for the next three years! She&#8217;s doing
speedwork on the track like, every other day. I couldn&#8217;t take it, man. I
was supposed to run with her once at six in the morning, and I called her
up at two a.m. to tell her I was shitfaced on margaritas and puh-robably
not gonna make&nbsp;it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jenn didn&#8217;t have a coach or a training program; she didn&#8217;t even own a
watch. She just rolled out of bed every morning, downed a veggie burger,
and ran as far and as fast as she felt like, which usually turned out to be
about twenty miles. Then she hopped on the skateboard she&#8217;d bought instead
of a parking pass and kicked off to class at Old Dominion, where she&#8217;d
recently dropped back into school and was making straight&nbsp;As.</p>
