`Adam Thurlow <mailto:adam@sheepdoginc.ca>`_, software engineer at SheepDogInc

    I have had the pleasure of working very closely with Honza since he started
    at SheepDog. He's an adroit developer who's always willing to put in the
    extra effort to learn something new or solve a challenging problem.
    Although quite talented, he is ever humble often touting *I'm just the
    junior developer* or *What do I know? I didn't go to CS school.*. Honza is
    very forward-looking and is always evangelizing the gems he stumbles upon.
    This passion and persistence about new technology has made a resounding
    impact on how our team works together.

`Ron Singer <mailto:ron.singer@sheepdoginc.ca>`_, Senior Project Manager at
SheepDogInc


    I had the pleasure of working with Honza at SheepDog on several custom
    software development projects. Honza is a highly skilled developer who can
    solve complex coding issues while providing high quality results accepted
    by the customer. Honza has superb customer facing skills. A real team
    player always supporting other team members. I was impressed by Honza's
    quest for continuous improvement by offering countless best practice tips
    and information to Developer Group. I would highly recommend adding Honza
    to your team.

`David Wolfe <mailto:wolfe@sheepdoginc.ca>`_, R & D Team Lead at SheepDogInc

    Honza is sharp. Really sharp. And very friendly. He keeps up with the
    open-source community. If I ever want to know what's new, he's the first
    person I turn to. And, of course, his code is great.

`Mark Long <mailto:mark.long@sheepdoginc.ca>`_, AppDev director at SheepDogInc

    Anything Honza lacks in formal background, he more than makes up in natural
    talent and unadulterated passion for writing great software. We quite
    literally hired Honza on the spot, and he was writing production ready code
    for a complex application days later. Honza is a true evangelist for all
    things open-source, and he constantly pushed us ahead of the curve by
    promoting better practices and technologies. I would recommend Honza
    wholeheartedly to any shop looking for a young, bright engineer that will
    undoubtedly put his dent in the industry as whole.
