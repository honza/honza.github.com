`MJ Coren <https://twitter.com/mjcoren>`_, CEO at Publet (March 2016)

    Honza's analytical and coding skills put him in a category of his
    own. Functional programming, python, tweets and even javascript: he does
    them all well. Honza has identified, assessed and solved complex problems so
    many times without breaking a sweat, I learned my confidence was never
    misplaced. You're in good hands.

`Steve Losh <http://stevelosh.com/>`_, senior developer at Amara

    Honza's a great programmer who can handle whatever you throw at him (even
    the particularly hairy stuff). His ever-expanding list of programming
    languages shows that he's always improving and trying to find better ways
    to get things done.

`Craig Zheng <http://craigzheng.com/>`_, Product director at Amara

    Honza is by all measures a fantastic programmer—efficient, thorough,
    organized, knowledgable. But what stands out above all else when you work
    with him is his curiosity and his drive. He has a thirst for learning and
    discovery. He approaches every task with the enthusiasm of someone about to
    learn something life-changing, and as a result you get much more than
    careful, meticulous work. You get someone who goes above and beyond—who
    asks incisive questions, devises creative solutions, and constantly brings
    new knowledge and new ideas to a team. He makes the people around him
    better, and I can't think of any quality more important than that.

`Nick Sergeant <http://nicksergeant.com/>`_, front-end web developer at Amara

    Honza is a great programmer with a serious attention to detail. Integrating
    him into our team was a seamless process and he began producing
    immediately. His curiosity shines through with his side projects and it
    always sparks ideas and collaboration with the team. Honza + programming =
    win!

`Arthur Debert <http://www.stimuli.com.br/>`_, senior developer at Amara

    I've had the pleasure of working with Honza daily for the past year. In
    that time, I've seen Honza tackle complex problems smartly and get things
    done. He's able to dabble in various stacks and is always learning new
    things.

`Nicholas Reville <http://pculture.org/pcf/about/>`_, executive director at
Amara

    Honza is an outstanding developer, with great attention to detail, engaging
    team spirit and a lot of focus. He gets things done. Highly recommended!

`Adam Thurlow <mailto:adam@sheepdoginc.ca>`_, software engineer at SheepDogInc

    I have had the pleasure of working very closely with Honza since he started
    at SheepDog. He's an adroit developer who's always willing to put in the
    extra effort to learn something new or solve a challenging problem.
    Although quite talented, he is ever humble often touting *I'm just the
    junior developer* or *What do I know? I didn't go to CS school.*. Honza is
    very forward-looking and is always evangelizing the gems he stumbles upon.
    This passion and persistence about new technology has made a resounding
    impact on how our team works together.

`Ron Singer <mailto:ron.singer@sheepdoginc.ca>`_, Senior Project Manager at
SheepDogInc


    I had the pleasure of working with Honza at SheepDog on several custom
    software development projects. Honza is a highly skilled developer who can
    solve complex coding issues while providing high quality results accepted
    by the customer. Honza has superb customer facing skills. A real team
    player always supporting other team members. I was impressed by Honza's
    quest for continuous improvement by offering countless best practice tips
    and information to Developer Group. I would highly recommend adding Honza
    to your team.

`David Wolfe <mailto:wolfe@sheepdoginc.ca>`_, R & D Team Lead at SheepDogInc

    Honza is sharp. Really sharp. And very friendly. He keeps up with the
    open-source community. If I ever want to know what's new, he's the first
    person I turn to. And, of course, his code is great.

`Mark Long <mailto:mark.long@sheepdoginc.ca>`_, AppDev director at SheepDogInc

    Anything Honza lacks in formal background, he more than makes up in natural
    talent and unadulterated passion for writing great software. We quite
    literally hired Honza on the spot, and he was writing production ready code
    for a complex application days later. Honza is a true evangelist for all
    things open-source, and he constantly pushed us ahead of the curve by
    promoting better practices and technologies. I would recommend Honza
    wholeheartedly to any shop looking for a young, bright engineer that will
    undoubtedly put his dent in the industry as whole.

Personal
~~~~~~~~

I'm originally from the Czech republic.  I'm married to a Canadian and have
three children.  When I'm not programming, I enjoy photography, movies and
GeoCaching.
