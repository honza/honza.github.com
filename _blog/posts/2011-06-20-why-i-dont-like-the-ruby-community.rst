Why I don't like the Ruby community
===================================

I write Python and Javascript code. I use Django and jQuery. And I cringe every
time I have to run ``gem install x``. I only have a limited understanding of
Ruby and hardly any of Ruby on Rails. It seems disorganized to me and hard to
process. All this is fine -- I don't have to use any of it if I don't like it,
right?

I always knew there was something wrong with the way Ruby works. I don't mean
wrong like murdering children, I just mean wrong like I don't know why things
are the way they are. There are a lot of talented Ruby programmers and I don't
mean to dismiss that.

Recently, though, I came across a tweet that I made me realize what it was that
I didn't like about Ruby. It was like a small revelation.

    Markup is markup, not Ruby. JavaScript is JavaScript, not Ruby. CSS is CSS,
    not Ruby. Get that in your head before I slap you. - `@ara_p`_

Do you get it? `ERB`_ is Ruby with some html-like fragments mixed in.
`CoffeeScript`_ is a Ruby-like language that compiles to Javascript. `Sass`_ is
a Ruby-like language for writing css files. 

Before you know it, everything will be in Ruby.
