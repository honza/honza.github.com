Text editor UI
==============

    What I don't understand is: why should you ever care how your editor looks,
    unless you're trying to win a screenshot competition?  The primary factor
    in looking good should be the choice of a good font at a comfortable size,
    and a syntax coloring theme that you like.  And that is not something
    specific to an editor.  Editors like Emacs and vi have almost no UI!  If
    Emacs is configured right, the only UI it has is the modeline and the
    minibuffer.
