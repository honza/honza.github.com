Scalability and feet and asses
==============================

I love talking about scalability. Everyone has their own opinion, their own way
of performing benchmarks and their own conclusions. And we all know that this
is *very* silly. I recently came across an article by `Ted Dziuba`_ that
summarizes it very nicely for you:

    Shut up about scalability, no one is using your app anyway.

I love how the author explains the use of the word *scalability* in this day
and age:

    The most common butthurt about scalability is this: choose a technology. If
    you like the technology, claim "technology X scales better!" If you don't
    like it, claim "technology X doesn't scale!"

You can find the article `here`_.
