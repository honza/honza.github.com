Apple Finally Catches Up To Linux
=================================

Apple recently unveiled their newest venture. It's called the App Store, and
I'm sure you've heard of it. It's a place on your computer that lets you
download and discover new applications. Just like the package manager on most
Linux distributions.

Except Linux has had 'app stores' for years. Welcome to 21st century computing,
Apple.
