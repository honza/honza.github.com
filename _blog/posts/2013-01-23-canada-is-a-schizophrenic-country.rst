Canada is a schizophrenic country
=================================

I have now lived in Canada for over two years and there are some things that
Canadians can't seem to make up their mind on.

Spelling
--------

Canadian spelling is stuck half way between British spelling and American
spelling.  Canadians will say:

* colour, favourite, honour (which are all British)
* program, realize (which are all American)

Measuring units
---------------

When you're driving in Canada, everything is in kilometers.  Snow fall is
measured in centimeters.  And yet, people insist on weighing and measuring
themselves in pounds.  We just had a baby girl here in Canada and they kept
saying, *Look she is so big, she is probably over eight.*.  Sure, she was nice
and big but she certainly didn't weight 8kg!  People ask me, *How tall are
you?*, and I respond with 178 and receive blank stares.
