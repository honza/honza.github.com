The latest greatest technology
==============================

I just found an interesting quote by `Thomas Fuchs`_, the creator of
script.aculo.us and a core member of the Prototype team. The quote is from his
`Setup`_ interview:

    For computer programmers, especially if you're self-employed, there's no
    excuse whatsoever not to get the latest and greatest. You don't really have
    other expenses anyway, it's tax-deductible and, most importantly, it will
    make you happy and more productive if you know that you're using the best
    available tools.

Do you agree?
