10 chapters
===========

* You get through the less glamorous parts while still being nourished.
* It's not a *read-your-bible-in-a-year* plan.  It's more of a plan for reading
  the Bible as a way of life.  You're never done.
* You don't read the Bible so many times in a year.  You read Acts 12 times,
  all gospels 4 times, etc.
* You always read different things together.
* There isn't as much guilt when skipping a day because you don't fall behind.
* 10 chapters a day might be a lot for some people but I find it a nice
  balance.
