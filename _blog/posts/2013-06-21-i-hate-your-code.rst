I hate your code
================

When starting to work on an existing codebase, I often find myself in a state
of despair.  The code doesn't make any sense, the programmers must have all
been idiots, why *on earth* would they do it like this, ...  I hate everything
about the code.

I spend hours going through it, thinking to myself, *I would have done a much
better job writing this* and making a list of changes that *must* be done in
order for the project to conform to my standards.

But then, when I have spent enough time reading everything, something clicks in
my mind.  I see what the authors were trying to do and everything makes sense.
It's actually kind of clever.

And I feel dumb.  Every time.
