Gender inclusive language
=========================

In a `recent sermon`_ at our church, a pastor student said to us that we are no
longer able to say that Jesus will make his disciples *fishers of men*. Rather,
she suggested, we should use the politically correct phrase *fishers of
people*.

There is always talk of gender-inclusive language when it comes to Bible
translation.  But this one seems a little too far.  Or it doesn't feel right.

As I have been thinking about this, I came across other things we say that that
are sexist in this way that don't seem to bother anyone.

1.  Watch any detective show and without fail, the perpetrator or killer will
    be called *he* and *him*.  Women never kill.

2.  Within the committees of our church, we longer say *chairman* but
    *chairperson*.  If we were to follow that same logic, we should refer to
    *snowmen* as *snowpeople*.

3.  The other day, my family visited my mother-in-law while she was selling her
    home & gift products at an event.  At one point, she said "... I can't I'm
    manning my table."  Was she really?  Shouldn't she have said *womanning*?

A little absurd.
