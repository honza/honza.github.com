I have tried dozens of code editors, text editors and IDEs. I have carefully
weighed the pros and cons of each. I have studied features, extensibility,
themes, syntax highlighting options, price, and many other criteria. I have
reached my verdict and I'm ready to publish my findings.

The best IDE is the one that works for you.
