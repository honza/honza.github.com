Several weeks ago, I had a few friends over to our house to watch Les Lanphere's
excellent [Calvinist](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/calvinist/calvinist-documentary-film) documentary. I assumed this would be their first
exposure to Reformed theology, so I expected some lively discussion. About half
way through the movie, we had to pause to answer a simple clarification
question. Once that was done, one of the guys volunteered an interesting
observation. He said: "I hope they show some quotes from Jesus, too. So far
it's just been Paul in Romans and Ephesians. I wonder what Jesus has to say
about that."

This little comment has been on my mind ever since. The traditional typography
of Bibles on the North American usually includes words of Christ in red. Having
grown up in Europe, I didn't encounter this until I came to Canada about ten
years ago. The motivation behind this typographic design is to give reverence
to the words of Christ because when he speaks, God himself speaks.
Unfortunately, what this leads to is that people treat other parts of the Bible
as less important. If it's not red, it's as if you don't really have to believe
it. This is a really bad way of reading the Bible and doing theology in
general.

A small typographic detail can make a huge difference in how we think about what
we're reading. It might be helpful for us to stop and think about the features
of our Bibles to see how all the references, footnotes, verse numbers, section
headings, verse-by-verse layouts affect our reading and understanding of the
text of Scripture.
