When starting to work on an existing codebase, I often find myself in a state
of despair. The code doesn't make any sense, the programmers must have all
been idiots, why _on earth_ would they do it like this, ... I hate everything
about the code.

I spend hours going through it, thinking to myself, _I would have done a much
better job writing this_ and making a list of changes that _must_ be done in
order for the project to conform to my standards.

But then, when I have spent enough time reading everything, something clicks in
my mind. I see what the authors were trying to do and everything makes sense.
It's actually kind of clever.

And I feel dumb. Every time.
