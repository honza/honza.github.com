Today, we have all heard about the new deal struck between Nokia and Microsoft.
It is a major change in Nokia's strategy which will without a doubt affect the
smartphone market.

A few month ago, the Executive Vice President of Nokia [announced](http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/09/22/nokia-evp-anssi-vanjoki-switching-to-android-is-like-peeing-in-your-pants-for-warmth/) that
switching to Android is like peeing in your boots for warmth. Well, let me say
this: if switching to Android is like peeing in your boots, switching to
Windows is like shitting your pants.

Perhaps, Nokia liked the latter better.
