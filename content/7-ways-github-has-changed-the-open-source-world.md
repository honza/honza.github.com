As the guys at [the changelog](http://thechangelog.com) say, the world of open source is changing fast
and you have to keep up. I believe that Github has been very influential when
it comes to making open source more accessible. How has Github changed the
world of open source?


## Force projects to include a good README {#force-projects-to-include-a-good-readme}

Apart from the directory structure and files, the most prominent element on the
page is your README file. If you don't have one, the page looks kind of weird. As
an administrator, if you don't add a README file, Github will start yelling at
you.


## Unified place for all your projects {#unified-place-for-all-your-projects}

When I come across a cool project, I like to see what other stuff the author
has been hacking on. The best example I think is [tpope](http://github.com/tpope) who is a famous
vim plugin creator. When you go to his profile page on Github, you can see all
of the plugins he has ever written and published.


## Code discussions {#code-discussions}

Yes, you can discuss the project on IRC or on mailing lists. Those aren't
exactly user friendly, and it's hard to discuss code that way. Github makes it
easy for you to submit a pull request and have others comment on your code.


## Publish your hacks with ease {#publish-your-hacks-with-ease}

Did you just write a patch that greatly improves an existing project? Fork it
and publish it in minutes. If you notify the original project, you can get
helpful feedback on your hacks. This encourages people to publish their code
even if it's never merged into the original project.


## Judge how active a project is {#judge-how-active-a-project-is}

Github makes it easy to quickly look through a project's history to see how
active it is. In no time, you can tell how many people commit to it and how
often. Also, the number of watchers/forks in the corner gives you a pretty good
idea of how many people are actually using the project. This is possibly my
favorite feature. Open source developers don't need to waste their time
exploring libraries that aren't maintained.


## Discover new projects {#discover-new-projects}

Smart people come up with clever things all the time. If they share their code
on Github, you can find it in the Explore Github section. I can't remember how
many times I've discovered a cool project this way. My favorite example is
[CoffeeScript](https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script).


## Follow the development of your favorite projects {#follow-the-development-of-your-favorite-projects}

When you first log in, you are presented with a list of changes that were made
to the projects you follow. This projects has a new release, this bug was
fixed. etc. Invaluable.

What are your thoughts? Any favorite features of Github?
