In [Matthew 18:23-35](http://esv.to/Mt18.23-35) we find the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant.  The
story goes like this: a king wants to settle his accounts, and calls to himself
his servant who owes him a sum of money.  The servant is unable to pay, and
falls down before the king, begging for mercy.  The king relents and wipes the
servant's slate clean.  The story follows from there, and the servant whom the
king forgave his debt is now demanding that his own servant pay him back the
money he is owed.  The second servant is likewike unable to repay the sum of
money, and begs for mercy.  The first servant, however, is harsh and doesn't act
in a merciful way.  He throws his debtor into jail.

The basic lesson here is that in Christ we have been forgiven a huge debt, and
therefore we should forgive others.

Last night, during family worship we read this passage in our reading of
Matthew.  I noticed that my ESV bible has a footnote for the amount that the
servant owed to the king.  In verse 24, it says that the sum was "ten thousand
talents", and then the footnote explains that a "talent was a monetary unit
worth about twenty years' wages for a laborer".  That sounds like a lot of
money.  But how much exactly?

We live in Canada, in the great province of Nova Scotia where minimum wage is
$11/h.  If we say that the average laborer works 40h per week, 52 weeks a year,
we can calculate the annual wage as approximately $22,880.  If we multiply that
by twenty, we will get $457,600, which is the rough value of a talent in today's
currency.  The servant had to pay the king 10,000 talents.  This is
$4,567,000,000.  Four and a half billion dollars.

Now imagine you owed someone that kind of money.  There is absolutely no way an
ordinary person could ever repay that.  And this is the size of our sin.  Our
sin is so vast that we can never repay God.  And _yet_, he forgives us.

So, how much did the second servant owe?  What amount had him thrown in jail?
In verse 28, it says the amonut was "a hundred denarii" and the footnote again
explains that a "denarius was a day's wage for a laborer".  One denarius is 8h
of work at $11/h, that is $88.  One hundred is then $8,800, the sum that the
second servant owed.  Not exactly pocket change but still _significantly_ less
than what the king forgave the first.  And so, we are to forgive others because
their debt to us is _significantly_ less than what God in Christ forgave us.
