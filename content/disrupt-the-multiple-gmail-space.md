We all know that Gmail is the best email provider out there. It's in the
browser, it's all ajaxy, you never delete anything, your emails are
cleverly organized into conversations, you know the drill...

But have you ever tried to use more than one account at a time? It's horribly
broken. Let's have a look at your options...


## Multiple sign-in {#multiple-sign-in}

Google allows you to log into more than one account at a time. They provide you
with a menu option to switch between the two and you are all set. The problem
is that the constant switching back and forth just isn't worth it.


## Use a desktop client {#use-a-desktop-client}

If you use a desktop client like Thunderbird or Mail.app, you can have as many
accounts as you want. But you don't get access to your contacts and rarely get
the nice conversation view for your messages. In addition, the applications are
often bloated and use a ton of memory.


## Use mutt or pino {#use-mutt-or-pino}

These light-weight applications are popular especially among programmers. They
are a pain to setup and lack email address autocompletion.


## Use multiple browsers {#use-multiple-browsers}

If you have one or two Gmail accounts, you could probably get away with using
two browsers - one for each account. This is silly and you shouldn't do that.


## Use Chrome profiles {#use-chrome-profiles}

Newer versions of Chome will allow you to be logged into different Gmail
accounts in different windows. This means that each window is logged into a
single Google account and can only access the services associated with that
account. This is fine for two accounts, but if you have 4+ it can get
ridiculous pretty fast.

None of these options give you a good solution for a unified inbox. They all
have their shortcomings.

There is a huge opportunity to disrupt this space as they are a lot of us who
have to use a lot of different Gmail accounts.

I have been using Mozilla Thunderbird with two add-ons: Google contacts and
Google Conversations. They are rather close to doing the right thing but it's
still missing something. I tried to set up mutt but it wasn't working for me
because of the missing autocomplete.


## Your say {#your-say}

What do you use? How do you deal with this mess?
