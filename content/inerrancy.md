As evangelical Christians, we believe in what is called the inerrancy of the
Bible. This means that we believe that the Word of God contains no mistakes. I
love the way pastor Mark Driscoll puts it:

> If we see something in the Bible that we don't agree with, it means we're
> wrong.

I am continually amazed at how many people will dismiss entire passages in the
Bible as silly or primitive. We are intelligent modern people, we don't believe
in fairy tales. We have democracy now. We believe in equality.

Let me remind you that the Bible is the book that God wrote. Is God different
today and yesterday?

Augustine:

> If you believe what you like in the gospel, and reject what you don't like,
> it is not the gospel you believe, but yourself.

1.  A. Carson:

> Those who don't have a high view of Scripture, do not feel bound to obey
> it.
