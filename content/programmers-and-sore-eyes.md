Under normal circumstances, the human eye should blink about once every 5
seconds. When you stare at an LCD screen all day long, the blink interval gets
larger. As a result, your eyes become dry and sore. This is further worsened by
coffee. Drinking lots of water and using over-the-counter drops will help. This
is what my eye doctor told me yesterday.
