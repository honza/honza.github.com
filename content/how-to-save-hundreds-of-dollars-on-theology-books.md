We, as theology nerds, love our books. Especially by authors who have long
passed on to glory. And who wouldn't want to save some money?

Here is what you do:

## Step 1: Buy an Amazon Kindle {#step-1-buy-an-amazon-kindle}

The base model is \$79. You can find it on sale during the usual sale events.
Or, for a more comfortable reading experience, you can go for the Paperwhite,
which is about twice as much. Both are excellent options. The advantage of the
Paperwhite is the backlight, and the higher screen resolution.

## Step 2: Acquire books {#step-2-acquire-books}

Head over to Monergism's [huge list](https://www.monergism.com/400-free-ebooks-listed-alphabetically-author) of free theology ebooks. Scroll through
the list, find something you like, download it to your Kindle.

## Step 3: Profit {#step-3-profit}

If there are 400 books, and if you downloaded each one, and if the printed paper
copy cost at least $1 (which it probably costs a _lot_ more), you are saving at
least $300.

If we assume that each book on the list has an average price of $30, you are
saving about $12,000.
