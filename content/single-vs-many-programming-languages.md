Junior programmers will often ask, "Which language should I use?", "Which
programming language is the best?", and when they discover this new hip
programming language that's meant to solve all of their scaling problems, they
get in your face and mock you for not using it for every single task. They
will write blog posts titled "X language for Y programmers" in hopes of
converting the masses to their newfound toy.

Smug senior programmers will laugh at the junior programmers and say that you
should learn a great many different languages to expand your horizons. A
single language cannot possibly suffice in this day and age. Each language has
its own set of libraries, each is better suited for a particular task.
Learning new languages will make you a better developer overall. Plus,
marketing yourself as an X language developer limits your choice of employer.

Business people will have yet another approach. Their product is obviously
written in some language or another so they _need_ developer who can speak that
language. Their platform is growing like crazy so they put up job posts
screaming "X language developer needed!". This creates a perceived demand for
a certain kind of developer. Developer will start to feel the need to learn
this newly popular technology and start by reading a "X language for Y
programmers" post and thus completing the circle.
