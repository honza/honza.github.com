In a [recent sermon](http://www.bedfordbaptist.ca/services/156) at our church, a pastor student said to us that we are no
longer able to say that Jesus will make his disciples _fishers of men_. Rather,
she suggested, we should use the politically correct phrase _fishers of
people_.

There is always talk of gender-inclusive language when it comes to Bible
translation. But this one seems a little too far. Or it doesn't feel right.

As I have been thinking about this, I came across other things we say that that
are sexist in this way that don't seem to bother anyone.

## Watch any detective show and without fail, the perpetrator or killer will {#watch-any-detective-show-and-without-fail-the-perpetrator-or-killer-will}

be called _he_ and _him_. Women never kill.

## Within the committees of our church, we longer say _chairman_ but {#within-the-committees-of-our-church-we-longer-say-chairman-but}

_chairperson_. If we were to follow that same logic, we should refer to
_snowmen_ as _snowpeople_.

## The other day, my family visited my mother-in-law while she was selling her {#the-other-day-my-family-visited-my-mother-in-law-while-she-was-selling-her}

home & gift products at an event. At one point, she said "... I can't I'm
manning my table." Was she really? Shouldn't she have said _womanning_?

A little absurd.
