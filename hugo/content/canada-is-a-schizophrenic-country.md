I have now lived in Canada for over two years and there are some things that
Canadians can't seem to make up their mind on.

## Spelling {#spelling}

Canadian spelling is stuck half way between British spelling and American
spelling. Canadians will say:

### colour, favourite, honour (which are all British) {#colour-favourite-honour--which-are-all-british}

### program, realize (which are all American) {#program-realize--which-are-all-american}

## Measuring units {#measuring-units}

When you're driving in Canada, everything is in kilometers. Snow fall is
measured in centimeters. And yet, people insist on weighing and measuring
themselves in pounds. We just had a baby girl here in Canada and they kept
saying, _Look she is so big, she is probably over eight._. Sure, she was nice
and big but she certainly didn't weight 8kg! People ask me, _How tall are
you?_, and I respond with 178 and receive blank stares.
