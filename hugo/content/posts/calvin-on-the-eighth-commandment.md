"In sum, then, God forbids any attempt to take the goods of others for
ourselves, and thus commands us to faithfully preserve for others their
property.  We must judge that whatever a person possesses has not come to him by
accident but through the provision of God, and that to deprive him of his wealth
is thus to sin against God's dispensation."

--- John Calvin, _The Institutes of the Christian Religion_, (Edinburgh, UK:
Banner of Truth, 2014), 154.
