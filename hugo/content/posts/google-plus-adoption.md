Google+ has been the target of numerous jokes in the tech community.  Many
blogs claim that adoption has been minimal and that the product isn't appealing
to common users over alternatives such as Facebook.

I have noticed quite the opposite is true.  Many of my extended family in the
Czech Republic have somewhat recently acquired new Android devices.  One by
one, they have added me to their circles on Google+.  My stream is now full of
pictures that my parents, aunts and uncles took with their phones.  Google
uploads those pictures as soon as you take them and reminds you to share them.
This interface is so simple that even the average joe can share their content
online.

The way I see it, Google is doing something right.
