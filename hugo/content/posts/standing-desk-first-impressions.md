I have recently switched jobs and had to set up a home office.  I have heard a
lot of good things about standing desks and thought this was the perfect
opportunity to try one.  I had looked for one online but those things aren't
cheap (~ $800).

Instead of dropping some serious cash, I stacked up some bins and made a
poorman's standing desk.  I have a laptop stand and a second monitor.  Nothing
special, really.

I have been standing while programming for over a week now and I wanted to
share a few thoughts.  If you're wondering if you should get a standing desk,
I'd definitely recommend it.


## Incentives {#incentives}

I have set up my desk in such a way that if I want to sit down to do some work
I have to give up the second monitor and my Das keyboard.  I use a 13" Macbook
Pro so the number of pixels is rather limited.  I _love_ my loud Das keyboard
and want to use it as much as possible.  This works extremely well.


## Breaks {#breaks}

When I take a break to have lunch with my family (or something like that), I
make it a point to sit down and rest my feet.  When I get back in the office, I
don't feel like I'm gonna die.


## Distractions {#distractions}

I have found that when I'm standing I rarely check Hacker News or read
articles.  I think it's because reading an article or two isn't complex enough
for my brain and it can do other things at the same time---like think about how
much my feet hurt.  I find that when I'm standing I get a lot more done because
I can focus a lot more.  Near the end of the day when I'm tired and actually do
sit down to work, I feel like I'm walking under water.  Since I'm just getting
started I have allowed myself some slack here and there.  I don't want to go
too fast and _burn out_.


## Dancing {#dancing}

I have heard that people like to dance when they're standing at their desk.  I
always thought this was pretty silly until I caught myself doing it.  I listen
to a lot of rock n roll so it's not exactly surprising.


## Pain {#pain}

Obviously, your feet will hurt.  However, it's not nearly as bad as I thought.
I'm 23 and fairly fit so maybe that's a factor.  I have had some minor lower
back pain which I think is caused by the fact that I now have good posture and
the body isn't used to it.


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Do you stand while working?  Ever thought about getting a standing desk?
