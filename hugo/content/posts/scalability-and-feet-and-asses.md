I love talking about scalability. Everyone has their own opinion, their own way
of performing benchmarks and their own conclusions. And we all know that this
is _very_ silly. I recently came across an article by [Ted Dziuba](http://twitter.com/dozba) that
summarizes it very nicely for you:

> Shut up about scalability, no one is using your app anyway.

I love how the author explains the use of the word _scalability_ in this day
and age:

> The most common butthurt about scalability is this: choose a technology. If
> you like the technology, claim "technology X scales better!" If you don't
> like it, claim "technology X doesn't scale!"
