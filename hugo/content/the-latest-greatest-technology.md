I just found an interesting quote by [Thomas Fuchs](http://mir.aculo.us/), the creator of
script.aculo.us and a core member of the Prototype team. The quote is from his
[Setup](http://thomas.fuchs.usesthis.com/) interview:

> For computer programmers, especially if you're self-employed, there's no
> excuse whatsoever not to get the latest and greatest. You don't really have
> other expenses anyway, it's tax-deductible and, most importantly, it will
> make you happy and more productive if you know that you're using the best
> available tools.

Do you agree?
