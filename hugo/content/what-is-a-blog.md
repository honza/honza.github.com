I have noticed that many people don't know what a blog is, so I would like to
talk about that briefly.

A blog is a website. A blog has many _entries_ or _posts_. To write a post
means to update your existing blog with a new article. To create or write a new
blog means to start a new website.

Please, don't say that you are going write a blog when you mean you will write
a post. That would be wrong. OK?
