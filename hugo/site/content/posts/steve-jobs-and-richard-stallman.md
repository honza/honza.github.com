Today, news [broke](http://stallman.org/archives/2011-jul-oct.html#06%5FOctober%5F2011%5F(Steve%5FJobs)) about Richard Stallman's comment on Steve Job's death. The
news of the giant's passing has stirred up a wave of emotions ranging from
utter sadness to feelings of empowerment to do great things. Tributes were paid
to Steve Jobs all over the internet. His life is described as one of a genius.
Technology celebrities have publicly commented on his death.

Richard Stallman said the following:

> I'm not glad he's dead, but I'm glad he's gone.

While this could have been said better, I'm absolutely shocked by the harsh
comments the community has made towards Dr Stallman. I'm not trying to defend
him. He is a caricature like no other. The man possesses no social skills. But
he is a respected computer engineer that has changed the way software works
today. He has a [number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard%5FStallman#Recognition) of doctorates. Like Steve Jobs, Dr Stallman is a
programming genius. His work on the GCC compiler is substantial.

Articles like the on [ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/10/why-fsf-founder-richard-stallm.php) are very disappointing. Let's all be
civil and respectful of each other.
