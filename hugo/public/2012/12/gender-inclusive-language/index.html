<article>
  

<p>In a <a href="http://www.bedfordbaptist.ca/services/156">recent sermon</a> at our church, a pastor student said to us that we are no
longer able to say that Jesus will make his disciples <em>fishers of men</em>. Rather,
she suggested, we should use the politically correct phrase <em>fishers of
people</em>.</p>

<p>There is always talk of gender-inclusive language when it comes to Bible
translation.  But this one seems a little too far.  Or it doesn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>

<p>As I have been thinking about this, I came across other things we say that that
are sexist in this way that don&rsquo;t seem to bother anyone.</p>

<h2 id="watch-any-detective-show-and-without-fail-the-perpetrator-or-killer-will">Watch any detective show and without fail, the perpetrator or killer will</h2>

<p>be called <em>he</em> and <em>him</em>.  Women never kill.</p>

<h2 id="within-the-committees-of-our-church-we-longer-say-chairman-but">Within the committees of our church, we longer say <em>chairman</em> but</h2>

<p><em>chairperson</em>.  If we were to follow that same logic, we should refer to
<em>snowmen</em> as <em>snowpeople</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-other-day-my-family-visited-my-mother-in-law-while-she-was-selling-her">The other day, my family visited my mother-in-law while she was selling her</h2>

<p>home &amp; gift products at an event.  At one point, she said &ldquo;&hellip; I can&rsquo;t I&rsquo;m
manning my table.&rdquo;  Was she really?  Shouldn&rsquo;t she have said <em>womanning</em>?</p>

<p>A little absurd.</p>
