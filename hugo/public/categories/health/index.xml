      <description>Under normal circumstances, the human eye should blink about once every 5 seconds. When you stare at an LCD screen all day long, the blink interval gets larger. As a result, your eyes become dry and sore. This is further worsened by coffee. Drinking lots of water and using over-the-counter drops will help. This is what my eye doctor told me yesterday.</description>
