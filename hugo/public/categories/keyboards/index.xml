      <description>For years now, I have wanted to switch my keyboard layout from QWERTY to something more ergonomic. QWERTY was designed to prevent typewriters from jamming. Modern computers don&amp;rsquo;t have this problem. So, why are we still using QWERTY?
So, for me, it&amp;rsquo;s a given that I should switch to something else. But what? The Dvorak layout is the obvious choice. Most people who switch from QWERTY end up using Dvorak.</description>
