      <description>It is a universally acknowledged truth that remembering your passwords is a bad idea. The modern Internet user will inevitably be required to register for many services, and websites, and inventing a new password for each one will quickly overwhelm him or her. The burden of memorizing one&amp;rsquo;s passwords is too great to bear. Unless, of course, we grant that passwords may be reused&amp;mdash;that we shall never do. Once we are satisfied that keeping all of one&amp;rsquo;s passwords in one&amp;rsquo;s head is a bad idea, we shall proceed to delegating this task to computers.</description>
