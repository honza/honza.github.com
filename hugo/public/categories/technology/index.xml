      <description>I just found an interesting quote by Thomas Fuchs, the creator of script.aculo.us and a core member of the Prototype team. The quote is from his Setup interview:
 For computer programmers, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re self-employed, there&amp;rsquo;s no excuse whatsoever not to get the latest and greatest. You don&amp;rsquo;t really have other expenses anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s tax-deductible and, most importantly, it will make you happy and more productive if you know that you&amp;rsquo;re using the best available tools.</description>
