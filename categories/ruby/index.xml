      <description>I write Python and Javascript code. I use Django and jQuery. And I cringe every time I have to run gem install x. I only have a limited understanding of Ruby and hardly any of Ruby on Rails. It seems disorganized to me and hard to process. All this is fine &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t have to use any of it if I don&amp;rsquo;t like it, right?
I always knew there was something wrong with the way Ruby works.</description>
