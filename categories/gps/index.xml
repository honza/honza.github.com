      <description>When I was a kid, our family used to travel a lot. I grew up in central Europe and over the years, we visited most of continental Europe. This was in the early &amp;lsquo;90s. Usually, Mom would have a map on her lap and she would tell Dad where to go. To keep me and my little brother entertained, they gave us another map and we would follow along.
We had fun trying to pronounce funny city names and calculating distances that we had travelled that day.</description>
