      <description>Warning: this is a rant
Recently, I have made great progress in my journey towards Haskell enlightenment. I finally see how many of the little pieces of the Haskell puzzle fit together. At this point, I feel empowered to go forth and write useful programs. I read through the source of Scotty the web framework the other day, and I was very pleasantly surprised that I understood how it works. I absolutely love Haskell.</description>

      <description>Junior programmers will often ask, &amp;ldquo;Which language should I use?&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Which programming language is the best?&amp;ldquo;, and when they discover this new hip programming language that&amp;rsquo;s meant to solve all of their scaling problems, they get in your face and mock you for not using it for every single task. They will write blog posts titled &amp;ldquo;X language for Y programmers&amp;rdquo; in hopes of converting the masses to their newfound toy.</description>

      <description>I have recently switched jobs and had to set up a home office. I have heard a lot of good things about standing desks and thought this was the perfect opportunity to try one. I had looked for one online but those things aren&amp;rsquo;t cheap (~ $800).
Instead of dropping some serious cash, I stacked up some bins and made a poorman&amp;rsquo;s standing desk. I have a laptop stand and a second monitor.</description>
