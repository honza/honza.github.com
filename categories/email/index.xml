      <title>Disrupt the multiple-gmail space</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We all know that Gmail is the best email provider out there. It&amp;rsquo;s in the
browser, it&amp;rsquo;s all ajaxy, you never delete anything, your emails are
cleverly organized into conversations, you know the drill&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But have you ever tried to use more than one account at a time? It&amp;rsquo;s horribly
broken. Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look at your options&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;multiple-sign-in&#34;&gt;Multiple sign-in&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google allows you to log into more than one account at a time. They provide you
with a menu option to switch between the two and you are all set. The problem
is that the constant switching back and forth just isn&amp;rsquo;t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-a-desktop-client&#34;&gt;Use a desktop client&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use a desktop client like Thunderbird or Mail.app, you can have as many
accounts as you want. But you don&amp;rsquo;t get access to your contacts and rarely get
the nice conversation view for your messages. In addition, the applications are
often bloated and use a ton of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-mutt-or-pino&#34;&gt;Use mutt or pino&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These light-weight applications are popular especially among programmers. They
are a pain to setup and lack email address autocompletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-multiple-browsers&#34;&gt;Use multiple browsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have one or two Gmail accounts, you could probably get away with using
two browsers - one for each account. This is silly and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-chrome-profiles&#34;&gt;Use Chrome profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newer versions of Chome will allow you to be logged into different Gmail
accounts in different windows. This means that each window is logged into a
single Google account and can only access the services associated with that
account. This is fine for two accounts, but if you have 4+ it can get
ridiculous pretty fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of these options give you a good solution for a unified inbox. They all
have their shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a huge opportunity to disrupt this space as they are a lot of us who
have to use a lot of different Gmail accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been using Mozilla Thunderbird with two add-ons: Google contacts and
Google Conversations. They are rather close to doing the right thing but it&amp;rsquo;s
still missing something. I tried to set up mutt but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t working for me
because of the missing autocomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;your-say&#34;&gt;Your say&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you use? How do you deal with this mess?&lt;/p&gt;
