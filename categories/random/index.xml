      <description>I have noticed that many people don&amp;rsquo;t know what a blog is, so I would like to talk about that briefly.
 A blog is a type of website or part of a website. Blogs are usually maintained by an individual with regular entries. (&amp;hellip;) Entries are commonly displayed in reverse-chronological order. Blog can also be used as a verb, meaning to maintain or add content to a blog. Source: Wikipedia</description>
