      <title>If novels were formatted like bibles</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bibles are notorious for being cluttered with all kinds of content besides the
actual Word of God. Here is a list of common things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verse numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chapter headings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Translation footnotes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-references (in the text, and in the center column)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chain references&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pilcrows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traditional setting also includes things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Double column&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verse-by-verse setting (where each verse starts on a new line)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Words in italics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pronunciation marks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these tools might be helpful for study, they certain don&amp;rsquo;t help with
fluency in reading. They get in the way of your flow. As a result, you might
become tired more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, if bibles are to be read for extended periods of time, we should design
them in such a way to support that goal. This usually means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single column&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Larger font&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No references&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paragraph format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the vast majority of novels produced today looks like. Novels are
works of fiction meant for enjoyment. You should be able to read them
comfortably and easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we be free to read our bibles this way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Above, you see the first few sentences of the first chapter of Jane Austen&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;em&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/em&gt;. I broke it up into verses, started each verse on a new
line, added some references and footnotes, and pilcrows. You will also notice
the center column for references. The proportions of the page have been
inspired by R.L. Allan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC0VIrRCpPA&#34;&gt;Longprimer 62&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://honza.ca/img/austen.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt; of the whole page for download.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My journey to find the best Bible</title>

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; or, &lt;em&gt;ESV Pitt Minion in black goatskin review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been reading Mark Bertrand&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bibledesignblog.com/&#34;&gt;Bible Design Blog&lt;/a&gt; for a few years now.
Through his long-form writing, I have come to appreciate beautiful typography,
fine craftsmanship, single-column layouts, and attention to detail in modern
Bible-making. I even helped him with a website update several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the longest time, though, my reading was just that&amp;mdash;reading. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
imagine spending so much money on a single Bible. I already had a few Bibles
in the house, and there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any pressing need to buy another one. This
spring, after saving up some money, I decided to invest in a premium Bible. I
made a list of requirements, and I read and watched just about every review I
could find on the world wide web. I was searching for &lt;em&gt;the one&lt;/em&gt; Bible, the
elusive unicorn of typographic design. I read articles about how that Bible
doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist, and that I should just come to terms with the fact that I shall
have to acquire a few different Bibles, each one for its own intended purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became addicted to the idea of single-column design. I read all about it. I
could absolutely sign Mark Ward&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://byfaithweunderstand.com/bible-typography-manifesto/&#34;&gt;Bible Typography Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. Two years
before the search began, my wife bought me the single-volume
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.crossway.org/bibles/esv-readers-bible-cob/&#34;&gt;ESV Reader&amp;rsquo;s Bible&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Reader doesn&amp;rsquo;t work as &lt;em&gt;the one&lt;/em&gt; Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the start, I knew I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to become a Bible collector. I have no
desire to own thousands of dollars worth of Bibles. I wanted to acquire a
single Bible that I could use in many different scenarios. The primary
motivation for this is that over time, you get to know your Bible, and you will
learn where things are, and you can find them quickly. Professor Grant Horner
is an advocate of this argument in his &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sohmer.net/media/professor%5Fgrant%5Fhorners%5Fbible%5Freading%5Fsystem.pdf&#34;&gt;10 chapters per day reading plan&lt;/a&gt; which
I enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s see if we can put together a list of priorities. The Bible must work
during private reading, study, public worship, family worship, and adult Bible
study with others. It must be easy to read, and yet be small enough that it&amp;rsquo;s
practical to carry everywhere. It must be available in the English Standard
Version. It must be pleasing to the eye and to the touch. It should be
rendered in single-column layout. Since I want it to be as practical as
possible, it should come with verse numbers, and section headings. References
are unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was immediately captivated by Crossway&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.crossway.org/bibles/esv-heirloom-single-column-legacy-bible-none-gskn/&#34;&gt;ESV Heirloom Single Column
Legacy&lt;/a&gt;, and Cambridge&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cambridge.org/bibles/bible-versions/english-standard-version/clarion/#fWEczIpRK89Frx95.97&#34;&gt;Clarion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the Heirloom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/esv-heirloom-psalms.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/esv-heirloom-cover.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Photos via evangelicalbible.com&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging by the photos in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bibledesignblog.com/blog/2017/8/10/refined-in-every-sense-the-new-heirloom-legacy&#34;&gt;Mark Bertrand&amp;rsquo;s review of the new ESV Heirloom
Legacy&lt;/a&gt;, the Bible looks huge. This means two things for me: it features a
large, readable page, and it&amp;rsquo;s likely too big to carry everywhere. This would
make a great sit-at-home-and-read-for-hours Bible, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t drag it to
church with me. Still, the page looks amazing, single column; I love the
headings on the side instead of in the text. I like that it has verse numbers
and no references. It makes the text look clean. This Bible will set you back
275 USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the Clarion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/clarion-open.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/clarion-cover.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Photos via evangelicalbible.com&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Clarion is short and stout. I like the shape of it better than the Heirloom
Legacy. Given its supple cover, it can be difficult to hold. It features
references and a single-column text block. For some strange reason, the
references are on the outside. This causes the text of the Bible to dip into
the fold near the spine. Crossway&amp;rsquo;s Personal Reference Bible is also rendered
in a single column setting but its references are in the middle. This is a much
better solution in my opinion. Unfortunately, the Clarion seems to have problems
with ghosting (also known as show-through), page curling, and while it&amp;rsquo;s smaller
than the Heirloom, it&amp;rsquo;s still rather bulky. It&amp;rsquo;s about the same size as my ESV
Reader&amp;rsquo;s Bible which definitely isn&amp;rsquo;t very portable. The Clarion costs about
255 USD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two Bibles are absolutely excellent, and very expensive. If I were a
collector, I think both of these should be in my collection. However, that&amp;rsquo;s
not why we&amp;rsquo;re here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After dismissing the Heirloom and the Clarion, I was browsing publishers&amp;rsquo;
websites, and came across another Bible from Cambridge: the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cambridge.org/bibles/bible-versions/king-james-version/reference-editions/pitt-minion-first-edition/#EGkUW5ImTubwglOP.97&#34;&gt;Pitt Minion&lt;/a&gt;. The
size of this Bible is absolutely spot on: not too big (portable), and not too
small (readable), not too short and not fat. I absolutely love the black
goatskin edition with the red accent of a ribbon. Only problem? It&amp;rsquo;s double
column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I dismissed it&amp;mdash;almost immediately. Who would buy a double column
Bible in 2017? But I kept thinking about the Pitt Minion, and kept coming back
to it. I read all of Mark Bertrand&amp;rsquo;s reviews of it over and over. I think
there are at least four articles on his website dedicated to the Pitt Minion.
Mark&amp;rsquo;s argument for the Pitt Minion is that its columns are magic. There is
something about the ratio between the column&amp;rsquo;s width, the font size, and the
leading that makes it just work. This leads to high readability in spite of
the tiny 6.75 font. Also, the size of the Bible is somewhere in between a
pocket Bible and a medium sized Bible. This makes it unique in the kind of
situations you&amp;rsquo;d want to use it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also greatly benefited from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzZeN-hOXtiz9Q0YvVUee8A&#34;&gt;Matthew Everhard&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; videos. Matthew is a pastor
who uses a Pitt Minion has his take-it-with-you-everywhere Bible, and does a
video review once a year to show how the Bible is doing with daily use. I love
how the leather ages, and how the board covers soften as you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/quentel-1-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/quentel-2-small.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Photos via evangelicalbible.com&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is the price. I live in Canada, and shipping is around 50
USD, and I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to get hit with import tax fees, etc. The Bible
itself is about 175 USD. Evangelical Bible really needs to figure a better
distribution model for their awesome Bibles. A lot more people would buy them
if the shipping were cheaper (e.g. partner with Amazon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After much thought, I decided to order the Pitt Minion. Another huge reason
was its price. It costs about 150 USD and I even found a great deal on Amazon,
so I ended up paying about 100 USD (shipped). Compare that to the 225+ USD for
the Quentel. The Pitt Minion is a steal! I opted for the black goatskin which
to my eyes and heart looks the best. Just as a side note, you can get the
Clarion for about that price but with a much inferior leather cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/pitt-minion/20171025_0001_thumb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/pitt-minion/20171025_0002_thumb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just look at that delicious grain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/pitt-minion/20171025_0003_thumb.jpg&#34;/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book opens flat after a few days of handling it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/pitt-minion/20171025_0004_thumb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/pitt-minion/20171025_0005_thumb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice the red under gold art gilding on the sides of the pages. Just
gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/pitt-minion/20171025_0006_thumb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/pitt-minion/20171025_0007_thumb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the red accent that the ribbons provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/pitt-minion/20171025_0008_thumb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://honza.ca/images/pitt-minion/20171025_0009_thumb.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Photos by me, you can use them for any purpose&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was waiting for it to arrive in the mail, I was rather nervous about
the whole thing. But as soon as I opened the box, I was relieved and happy
with the new Bible. It far exceeded by expectations. It&amp;rsquo;s even more beautiful
than in the pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right out of the box, the Pitt Minion doesn&amp;rsquo;t open flat. You have to handle it
and read it for about a week, and then it will happily oblige. The quality of
the print is exceptional. Many reviewers have said that the font is small.
That might be true in the technical sense, but given the high quality of the
printing, the font doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel small. Think of it like this: your normal
Bible is like an old TV, it has very low resolution and unnatural colors. The
Pitt Minion is your latest 4K smart TV with life-like colors. Premium Bibles
stand out not just wit their binding and covers, but also with the quality of
the printing. I find the font size of the Pitt Minion luxurious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there is the question of the double column. I remain convinced on a
theoretical level that the single column layout is superior in readability.
However, it does in a sense waste space in poetry sections. This leads to more
bulk in the final form factor of the Bible. In practice, I don&amp;rsquo;t feel any
hindrance in reading the Pitt Minion. My eye can track the words easily, and I
don&amp;rsquo;t find I lose my place often when reading for extended periods of time.
Moreover, there is something to be said about the Bible looking like a Bible,
and double column is certainly the more traditional look. I realize this is a
pretty weak argument. With Cambridge, you are purchasing a piece of history or
Bible publishing history. Cambridge University Press is the world&amp;rsquo;s oldest
Bible printer and publisher. They have been in continuous operation since 1591
when they published the Geneva Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you handle a premium Bible, you won&amp;rsquo;t settle for inferior quality. I have
been reading from the Pitt Minion for several months now. I have carried it
many places. I travelled to Europe with it. I certainly don&amp;rsquo;t baby this Bible.
I fold back one side of the cover when reading, I roll it up when it&amp;rsquo;s closed,
and I take it with me when going out. I find it delightful, and it&amp;rsquo;s truly a
great all-around Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
