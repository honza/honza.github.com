      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have now lived in Canada for over two years and there are some things that
Canadians can&amp;rsquo;t seem to make up their mind on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;spelling&#34;&gt;Spelling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian spelling is stuck half way between British spelling and American
spelling.  Canadians will say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;colour-favourite-honour--which-are-all-british&#34;&gt;colour, favourite, honour (which are all British)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;program-realize--which-are-all-american&#34;&gt;program, realize (which are all American)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;measuring-units&#34;&gt;Measuring units&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re driving in Canada, everything is in kilometers.  Snow fall is
measured in centimeters.  And yet, people insist on weighing and measuring
themselves in pounds.  We just had a baby girl here in Canada and they kept
saying, &lt;em&gt;Look she is so big, she is probably over eight.&lt;/em&gt;.  Sure, she was nice
and big but she certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t weight 8kg!  People ask me, &lt;em&gt;How tall are
you?&lt;/em&gt;, and I respond with 178 and receive blank stares.&lt;/p&gt;
