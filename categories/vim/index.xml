      <description>(That&amp;rsquo;s quite a title, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?)
If you&amp;rsquo;re using vim to write Clojure code, chances are that you&amp;rsquo;re using Tim Pope&amp;rsquo;s vim-fireplace plugin. It&amp;rsquo;s really great. It stars an nREPL session in the background for you and lets you evaluate a form inside of vim. It&amp;rsquo;s super fast because it keeps the session around and it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite things about writing Clojure.
Recently, vim-fireplace received support for piggieback. Piggieback is a layer on top of nREPL that gives you support for ClojureScript.</description>

      <title>Text editor UI</title>

      <description>What I don&amp;rsquo;t understand is: why should you ever care how your editor looks, unless you&amp;rsquo;re trying to win a screenshot competition? The primary factor in looking good should be the choice of a good font at a comfortable size, and a syntax coloring theme that you like. And that is not something specific to an editor. Editors like Emacs and vi have almost no UI! If Emacs is configured right, the only UI it has is the modeline and the minibuffer.</description>

      <title>How To Convert Vim Colorschemes To Pygments Themes</title>

      <description>Recently, I have grown to love Pygments. It gives you syntax highlighting in the browser without heavy Javascript files. It supports just about any programming language on the planet and it&amp;rsquo;s just plain awesome. The only thing that it&amp;rsquo;s lacking is good color schemes. It comes with a dozen themes that will certainly do the trick, but if you&amp;rsquo;re used to looking at pretty code in your favorite editor, the code examples on your website will look a little dull.</description>
