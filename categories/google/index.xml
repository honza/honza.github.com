      <title>Google APIs - Y U NO WORK</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.sheepdoginc.ca&#34;&gt;SheepDogInc&lt;/a&gt;, I have been working with various Google APIs,
especially the Calendar API. The state of these APIs is rather &lt;em&gt;unfortunate&lt;/em&gt;.
Google is a web giant and you&amp;rsquo;d think that their APIs would be state-of-the-art
given the number of professionals they employ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;documentation&#34;&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we go anywhere, let me just talk about the documentation for a minute.
As an open-source software author and advocate, I always encourage developers
to write extensive and good documentation. Somehow, Google didn&amp;rsquo;t get the demo.
Most of their documentation is sparse, incorrect and out-of-date. If you would
like to know what data a call returns, you&amp;rsquo;re better off just making the call
and inspecting the response. This will actually save you time because the docs
are probably wrong anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reliability&#34;&gt;Reliability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is like the master of scalability. They have an estimated one million
servers world-wide. And yet, they cannot consistently return a 200 to an API
call. I have written horrible, horrible glue code and hacky workarounds to
account for this unpredictability. Sometimes you will get a response, sometimes
it will timeout, sometime you will get a 404&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;engineering&#34;&gt;Engineering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all these amazing engineers, can Google really not make a better API?
Honestly, if I was in a position to hire a person who worked on the Google API
team, I would think twice. Seriously &amp;mdash; test your app, keep your docs
up-to-date, and mainly, stop pissing me off!&lt;/p&gt;
