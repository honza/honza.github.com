      <description>Warning: this is a rant
Recently, I have made great progress in my journey towards Haskell enlightenment. I finally see how many of the little pieces of the Haskell puzzle fit together. At this point, I feel empowered to go forth and write useful programs. I read through the source of Scotty the web framework the other day, and I was very pleasantly surprised that I understood how it works. I absolutely love Haskell.</description>
