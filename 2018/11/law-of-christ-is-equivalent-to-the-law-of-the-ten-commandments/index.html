<article>
  <p>&ldquo;The law of Christ is identical to the law of the ten commandments.  Christ did
not give another law; Christ gave that law of the ten commandments.  To this
law He subjected Himself and has perfectly lived according to it, leaving us an
example therein.  He Himself is also a living law. Christ has never given
liberty to transgress any of the ten commandments, be it those that pertain to
murder, adultery, or theft, etc.  Thus, the law of Christ is the law of the ten
commandments.&rdquo;</p>
